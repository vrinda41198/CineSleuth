Scott', 'Eva Marie Saint', 'Harley Jane Kozak', 'Tim Curry', 'Marilu Henner', 'Peter Gallagher'], Released in the year: 1996, Summary of the movie plot: Titanic has three main story threads: *Isabella Paradine is traveling on the Titanic to join her husband after attending her aunt's funeral in England. On the Titanic, she meets Wynn Park, her former lover. She falls in love with him again, and after a brief affair, she sends her husband a wireless saying they cannot be together anymore . When the ship starts sinking, Isabella must reluctantly leaves Wynn when he forces her to board a lifeboat. As the boat is lowered, Isabella confesses a long kept secret that her daughter Claire is actually Wynn's. Later on board the RMS Carpathia she is grief-stricken when she finds Wynn's lifeless body on deck amongst other victims who have died of hypothermia, but luckily, when the Carpathia reaches New York she is reunited with her family, blissfully unaware of Isabella's tryst because the telegram was never sent out due to the sinking. *Also in first class is the Allison family, a real family who traveled on the Titanic, returning home to Montreal with their two small children and new nurse, Alice Cleaver. They gradually become wary and suspicious of her hysterical and neurotic behavior. Later on, a fellow maid asks her if she'd seen her in Cairo the previous month, but soon realizes that she remembers her from the highly publicized trial where Alice was accused of throwing her baby off a train. When the Titanic starts sinking, Alice Cleaver panics and quickly boards a lifeboat with Trevor, the Allisons' infant son. The parents with their small daughter are unaware that the baby is safe and refuse to leave the ship without him, which in the end costs them their lives. *In third class, a young vagrant named Jamie Perse steals a ticket to get on board. He manages to become friends with one of the crewmen, Simon Doonan, who is also a robber, but later is revealed to be a much more violent and callous criminal than Jamie. The young man falls in love with Aase  Ludvigsen, a recent Christian convert and missionary. On the night of the sinking, Aase is raped and beaten by Doonan, causing her to lose her faith and will to live, but Jamie manages to get her into Isabella's boat, #14. Unbeknownst to them, Doonan also sneaked on board that same boat, disguised as an old woman. After the ship sinks, Aase is knocked off the lifeboat by Doonan after recognizing him and he attempts holding all the passengers in the boat hostage with a revolver, but Officer Lowe, who is in charge of the boat, hits Doonan in the head with a paddle, snapping his neck. Jamie himself manages to survive when he accidentally falls into one of the last lifeboats before the Titanic sinks and atones for his past life after he finds Aase in the makeshift hospital aboard the Carpathia. In the end, upon arriving in New York, the two plan to start a new life together.\n"]}],"source":["print(movie_dataset[\"Titanic\"])"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"8H8ZCP19w8wf"},"source":["# **Reddit Test Dataset Setup**\n","\n","Source: Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthemoviecalled/comments/1cd1002/mom_and_son_in_space/\n","https://www.reddit.com/r/whatisthatmovie/comments/1ccvly8/black_and_white_old_movie/\n","https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthatfilm/comments/1138tjw/trying_to_find_a_movie_for_my_friend/\n","https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthatmoviecalled/"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"yIk10hMi-kmF","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1715999827626,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":762,"user":{"displayName":"NLP ATNV","userId":"06001106915299905656"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":17},"outputId":"cbf54ebc-3eba-48c2-ee3f-c7719dc51137"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"],"text/html":["\n","  <style>\n","    pre {\n","        white-space: pre-wrap;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","  "]},"metadata":{}}],"source":["test_file = 'dataset/test_data.tsv'\n","\n","reddit_test_movie_plots_data = {}\n","with open(test_file, mode='r', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n","    csv_reader = csv.reader(f, delimiter='\\t')\n","    for movie_data in csv_reader:\n","        movie_name = movie_data[1]\n","        movie_plot = movie_data[0]\n","        reddit_test_movie_plots_data[movie_name] = movie_plot"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(reddit_test_movie_plots_data.keys())"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":629},"id":"C0diL6s9umdF","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1715999827627,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":52,"user":{"displayName":"NLP ATNV","userId":"06001106915299905656"}},"outputId":"8794a110-0af3-493b-b73b-98eb7f7387b3"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"],"text/html":["\n","  <style>\n","    pre {\n","        white-space: pre-wrap;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","  "]},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["dict_keys(['In Search of Fellini', 'The Lodger', 'Jawbreaker', 'Black Mirror -

The king freaks out and chases the boy throughout the castle, but he didn’t see the boy’s face so he doesn’t know exactly who it is. He chases him back to the servant quarters which are like, a bunch of cots in a row with a ton of other servants sleeping in them. The servant boy lays down in his cot and pretends to be asleep, and the king comes down and starts to lean down and listen to all the servant’s hearts while they’re sleeping to see who’s heart is beating the fastest from running to find out which boy was kissing his daughter.

He's trying to get to a timeline to reunite his family. I fuzzily recall that he goes into an even worse timeline where his wife died although his original kid(s) are back, before the eventual happy ending. To be frank, it had a made-for-tv feel, almost like a Lifetime movie. Feels fairly recent nonetheless (at least, released after 2010-ish). Also the setting was possibly British (or northeastern US?) and the vibe was peculiarly conservative in its portrayal of dating and marriage.

The only part I saw of this movie was that there were two little boys and a woman. I think the boys were brothers and one was a few years older than the other. The younger one was probably 4 or 5 maybe. The boys tied up the woman to a chair. I don't believe this woman was their mom, but maybe it could be a gf of their dad or maybe their stepmom? That detail I'm not sure about, but the way they were treating her made it seem that way. The older boy was being mean to the woman but the younger boy was trying to get the woman a glass of water or something. On the way over to the woman, the youngest boy falls down and lands on the drinking glass, breaking it into pieces. The pieces of glass go into the boys chest or abdomen. The woman then starts begging the older boy to let her go so that she could take his brother to the hospital. I don't know the resolution since that was the only scene I watched, but this part is just ingrained in my mind ever since. I have no idea what the movie is called, who the actors are, or what the movie was mainly about.

She and her husband contact the police, who tries to trace them. At one point, when the woman says the man is on the phone, the husband tells her to keep him on the line so he can talk to him, I think so the police can trace it. But by the time he gets there, she hangs up, she says she was too scared to keep talking to him. The police officer investigating it talks to the husband, and implies that he suspects the woman is faking it. The husband is talking to a friend about it, and says he didn't like the police officer's implication, but then says he supposes it's his job to look at it from all angles. Later, the woman says the man is calling her, and everyone including the husband thinks she's hallucinating it, I think it's because the phone was disconnected or something like that, and she's sent to a psychiatric hospital. Then it turns out the husband was somehow behind it all, and he was planning to kill her, but I don't remember any other details. I think there's also a subplot, but I don't remember it.

Just after the parents received the bad news, they walked outside the doctor's office through a hallway. They were walking slowly towards the camera, and the camera was walking backwards. The wife was holding his husband's arm tightly, as if she was feeling that she was gonna faint. Again, formal clothes. I guess this is towards the end of the film. The mom decided to read a book for his son while he was paralytic in bed, not being able to move any single muscle. She started reading and reading but he remained motionless. But then, I don't remember if he blinked or moved his chin, the point is that the kid responded to his mom reading the book. That gave her hope that his son is still aware, so she continued to read.

She says that in the movie a young boy moved to a building where a girl had died after falling from the top of the stairs in the building. He decided to investigate her death and found out that what really happened was that she had jumped from the top so that her mother/nanny could catch her, but missed and she died. My friend also adds that the boy moved to the building to be with his uncle, who had a room full of taxidermy animals and the boy could not come inside. The animal's eyes were really diamonds, and those where important in the plot for solving some mystery or something.    I can't remember if she mentioned anything else, but these were the main points. She is not sure if the movie is Spanish (we are from Spain) or not, so maybe it was not really popular in other countries.    Maybe this description is not of one movie but two or more! She wouldn't be surprised if that was the case, as this is the only things she remembers.

I liked the movie enough to want to remember it and wrote it down, sadly that paper was lost years ago.    Anyways, I believe it to be British made film in where a man dealing with trauma has created inside himself the idea and narrative he is a superhero (who is actually currently in cell block CTscan if ya catch my drift), with this belief we see the man overlay his idea of how just he is being in his actions by being given the vivid imagery of a dystopian cityscape and him believing to be the antihero everyone is beckoning for. Multiple scenes of what seem a muted color and cool action stealth transpire. He has a nemesis throughout these “visions” however it is not immediately anthropomorphized in the storyline or plot. Alongside this bag of marbles doing his thing, people are living separately from his plot line, however, showing their struggles and problems. (More) normal people continue to thread together until the ending, where the escapee (superhero) tries to kill his father (nemesis) from a rooftop overlooking a restaurant where his father and said normies are dining.

Thom  and Dev , his gay bandmates, who both hate Tris, convince Nick to perform at a club because his favorite band‚Äîthe legendary, publicity-shy indie band Where's Fluffy?‚Äîis performing somewhere in New York City that night. Norah Silverberg  attends the same high school as Tris, Convent of the Sacred Heart and though Norah and Tris dislike each other, they have a mutual friend named Caroline . Norah, who shares Nick's taste in music, has been recovering his mix CDs after Tris discards them in the trash. That night, the three girls end up at Arlene's Grocery on Manhattan's Lower East Side, where The Jerk-Offs are playing. Norah asks Nick to pretend to be her boyfriend to show up Tris. Norah kisses him, unaware that he is Tris' ex-boyfriend. Caroline gets drunk and Norah wants to take her home, but Nick's bandmates - who see Norah as a potential new girlfriend for him - offer to take Caroline home so Norah and Nick can spend time together trying to find the show. After a confused Caroline escapes from Thom's van, Nick and Norah meet up again with Thom and Dev to try to find her. They first visit a club where Where's Fluffy? are rumored to be playing , but with no success. Tris, eager to win back Nick, follows them and gets a phone call from Caroline, who tells Norah that she has \"found Jesus\" and an altar boy without pants. They find a drunk Caroline on stage at a gay cabaret dressed as a Christmas tree. When they arrive at Nick's car, Tris is sitting on the hood waiting for him. Before Nick leaves to go to talk to her, Norah tells him how nice it was to meet him, but he leaves without a response. An upset Norah meets up at a club with her friend with benefits, Tal , but soon realizes that he has an ulterior motive and hopes to get a deal for his band with Norah's father, a record producer . She agrees to pay for Tal and his friends' drinks, but she tells the waitress to increase the tab because there was a miscalculation, and she leaves him to pay. Nick, meanwhile, decides to confront Tris, but she tells him she wants to be together again and asks for a ride home. Tris asks Nick to stop by the river, where she tries to seduce him. Whilst she seductively dances in front of the car, Nick reminisces fondly about Norah and the night's events and drives away, leaving Tris behind. Nick calls Norah, apologizing for leaving, and she agrees to meet him again. Deciding to go somewhere where no one they know will find them, they arrive at Electric Lady Studios, a music studio owned by Norah's father. Once there, Norah gets Nick to play something he wrote in the studio, but then joins him in the recording room. Inside, they kiss and it is implied that Nick twiddles her bits to bring her to orgasm. Norah gets a text message from Caroline telling her where she found Where's Fluffy? playing. When they arrive at the show, they meet Tris, who cannot understand why Nick will not take her back, and Tal, who wants the same answer from Norah. Tal starts a fight with Nick, but Thom and Dev's friend, Lethario , steps in and headbutts Tal. Nick and Norah share a smile and leave together. At Pennsylvania Station, Nick admits that he does not care about missing the concert, and they kiss on the escalator as the sun rises over New York City.\n","\n","    ### Response:  Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the details of the movie and the plot summary and idenitfy which movie is being described.\n","\n","    ### Context:\n","    Film Genre:['Thriller', 'Adventure', 'World cinema', 'History', 'Period piece', 'Coming of age', 'War film', 'Drama'], Starring the actors: ['Jesse van Driel', 'Martijn Lakemeier', 'Yorick van Wageningen', 'Jamie Campbell Bower', 'Raymond Thiry', 'Melody Klaver', 'Anneke Blok', 'Mees Peijnenburg', 'Dan van Husen', 'Tygo Gernandt', 'Ben Ramakers', 'Tibo Vandenborre', 'Jens Roth', 'Peter Eberst', 'Ad van Kempen'], Released in the year: 2008, Summary of the movie plot: The film is about a young Dutch boy named Michiel van Beusekom who tries to help the Dutch resistance during World War II by helping a British airman stay out of German hands during the occupation of the Netherlands. Michiel feels resentment towards his father, the mayor, who is seemingly only interested in maintaining the status quo between the town and the German Army. He worships his Uncle Ben, an adventurer in contact with the local resistance. During the winter, Michiel's loyalties are tested. An allied plane is hit in the air and crashes, but before it hits the ground, a young British airman is able to escape by parachute. One of the villagers, Dirk, helps the airman, Jack, but Dirk is arrested. Before his arrest, Dirk gives Michiel a letter to be delivered to Bertus, the village blacksmith. Before Michiel can deliver the letter, Bertus is shot and killed by the Germans. Michiel opens the letter, which directs him to Jack's hiding place in the forest. Jack is injured, and Michiel enlists the aid of his sister Erica, a nurse, to take care of him. Jack and Erica soon develop a romantic relationship. Michiel's father is arrested when the body of a German soldier, killed by Jack on the night of the plane crash, is found in the forest. Jack wants to turn himself in to save Michiel's father, but Ben tells Michiel he can save his father. Ben's efforts fail, and Michiel's father is shot by the Germans. Michiel ties to take Jack to the town of Zwolle, across a river, but the Germans foil their attempt, and the two narrowly escape after a chase through the forest. Michiel finally turns to his Uncle Ben for help in getting Jack to Zwolle. Ben agrees, and Ben, Jack and Erica set off for the bridge to Zwolle. As they leave, Ben tells Michiel that Dirk should never have gotten Michiel involved with Jack. After they go, Michiel realizes that he had never mentioned Dirk's role to Ben. Quickly checking Ben's suitcase, he finds papers showing that Ben is working for the Germans. Rushing to the river, Michiel stops the trio, grabs Jack's pistol, and confronts Ben.

Whether it is communal bias, social bias, economic bias, religious bias or educational bias, the \"bias\" factor dominates the entire depiction of the film, merging different characters into one story. The different biases that are incorporated into the film are as following: #Religious bias - A devout Muslim listens to the radical sermons of a religious leader that aims to instigate his followers to take revenge for the wrongdoings occurring within the Islamic community. This leads his followers to collaborate to create havoc in the city, but plans fail. However, when the plan is about to succeed, the follower decides to abort it, seeing a Hindu boy walk towards it. This child had previously helped a lost Muslim girl find her mother. #Communal bias - Rajpal Yadav is a Bihari who has just arrived in Mumbai, looking for work. In his quest for some money and food, Yadav encounters incredible bias against his community, with Marathis blaming his creed for taking away jobs and others ridiculing his sub-par technical skills. On the other side, a Brahmin politician opposes his son's courtship of a Dalit girl; however, he decides to exploit the relationship for political gain. #Social bias - Sarika is the administrator of a large hospital, running it with zeal and fervor. Seema Biswas is a poor woman who is trying to gather funds for her husband's bail money, as he has been framed in a fraudulent case. Biswas works at Sarika's house, cooking meals and cleaning the house. Despite Seema's honest work, Sarika continues to doubt her when things go missing, checking her purse and doubting her character. In the end, it is Biswas who comes to the aid of Sarika at a crucial moment. #Gender bias - Sarika's husband is a successful builder and owner of several Call Centre across Mumbai. Intoxicated with money and power, he finds himself unable to resist deflowering women, using every moment to lure women, by showering expensive gifts on them. However, a moment arrives where he finds himself on crossroads, unable to face the reality, but understanding its repercussions. #Economic bias - Perizaad Zorabian is a successful creative head of a channel. However, work and life has tensed her. She is unable to bear the hectic pressure of Mumbai and asks her husband to find work in either the United States or United Kingdom. Perizaad looks for opportunities to insult people and finds her financial power too strong to succumb to emotion. Biases of these sort weave the entire story into finding resolutions based on the biases of individuals and the reality of the lifestyle of Mumbai. The message clearly floated through movie is We have to learn to live together like Brothers or perish like Fools, as said by M. Luther King. This movie plot has certain similarities with the plot of Crash , an American movie starring Matt Dillon, Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Thandie Newton and Brendan Fraser.{{cite news}}\n","\n","    ### Response: 2009 Yeh Mera India\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the details of the movie and the plot summary and idenitfy which movie is being described.\n","\n","    ### Context:\n","    Film Genre:['Crime Fiction', 'Thriller', 'World cinema', 'Action/Adventure', 'Crime Thriller', 'Action'], Starring the actors: ['Oliver Reed', 'Steffen Zacharias', 'Paola Pitagora', 'Agostina Belli', 'Peter Berling', 'Reinhard Kolldehoff', 'Fabio Testi', 'Calisto Calisti', 'Daniel Beretta', 'Marc Mazza', 'Giovanni Pallavicino', 'Sal Borgese', 'Fr√©d√©ric de Pasquale'], Released in the year: 1973, Summary of the movie plot: An Italian official's wife is kidnapped, and the kidnappers demand that a notorious prisoner be released in order for the man to get his wife back.

In order to do this, they cross two borders, one with India and Bangladesh, and the second with India and Pakistan. The route from Bangladesh leads from Dhaka then to Guwahati then to Delhi then to Ajmer then to Bhuj, and then on to Pakistan's Haji Peer. They get as far as Bhuj, but afterward they are assisted by Jaan Mohammad's son, known only as Refugee, who helps them trek their way across the Rann desert to Atta Mohammad's house in Pakistan. Refugee considers his clients as mere items of luggage and refuses to be emotionally involved with them. Then he meets Nazneen and he forgets this rule, and they soon both fall in love with each other. Police on both sides of the border are aware of the refugee traffic and question Refugee and Jaan several times because of this. Then, one day, Refugee assists four men to enter the Indian side of the border. These men then enlist the help of Jaan's other son to get to Delhi. Shortly thereafter, explosions take place in trains, buses, and buildings. And to complicate matters even more, BSF Officer Raghuvir Singh apprehends Refugee with a load of RDX plastic explosives. While Naaz is making preparations for her marriage with Refugee, her parents have arranged her marriage with a Pakistani Ranger named Ashraf Mohammad. The question remains what will be Refugee's fate when Ashraf finds out that he is the truth of his wife-to-be, that is if he ever gets out of the clutches of the Border Security Force.\n","\n","    ### Response: 3 Deewarein\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the details of the movie and the plot summary and idenitfy which movie is being described.\n","\n","    ### Context:\n","    Film Genre:['Culture & Society', 'Environmental Science', 'Social issues', 'Documentary'], Starring the actors: information not available, Released in the year: 2009, Summary of the movie plot: Blue Gold: World Water Wars examines environmental and political implications of the planet's dwindling water supply, and posits that wars in the future will be fought over water.Film Review - Blue Gold: World Water Wars The film also highlights some success stories of water activists around the world and makes a strong case for community action.\n","\n","    ### Response: 2009: Blue Gold: World Water Wars\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the details of the movie and the plot summary and idenitfy which movie is being described.\n","\n","    ### Context:\n","    Film Genre:['Drama', 'Comedy'], Starring the actors: ['Ver√≥nica Echegui', 'Dani Martin', 'Laya Mart√≠', 'Gorka Lasaosa', 'Jos√© Chaves', 'Mercedes Hoyos'], Released in the year: 2006, Summary of the movie plot: Juani comes from a very poor background, having grown up in a poor suburban village of Spain.

Chronologically, the order would be: *The Second Renaissance - a prequel set generations before the original film, The Matrix, relating how humans built artificially intelligent Machines, the apocalyptic war between the two, ending with the Machines enslaving the human race and the initial creation of The Matrix virtual reality. *A Detective Story - a stand-alone story in which the character Trinity appears, but independently of any other characters. Because Trinity is present it takes place at least within several years of the films, and though it is not made clear within the cartoon if it takes place before or after Trinity met Neo in the original film, another official source places it before the events of The Matrix.Matrix Universe poster, included in Enter the Matrix: Official Strategy Guide, Bradygames, 2003. *Kid's Story - set during the six month gap between the events of the first and second films, after Neo joins the crew of the Nebuchadnezzar in freeing other humans from the Matrix. Its events are briefly alluded to in dialogue at the beginning of The Matrix Reloaded. *Final Flight of the Osiris - takes place directly before The Matrix Reloaded, as the hovercraft Osiris stumbles upon the Sentinel army digging to Zion. At the beginning of The Matrix Reloaded, Niobe mentions that their reconnaissance photos of the Machine army were transmitted from the Osiris. The other four shorts  are independent of the events of any other installment. While they generically deal with the virtual reality of the Matrix, and the Zion rebels, conceivably they could take place at any point in the generations-long struggle between the human rebels and the Machines running the Matrix. Like the Matrix trilogy, the entire movie except The Final Flight of the Osiris was rated R by the MPAA mainly for its Sci-Fi violence. When it was released on DVD, it was unrated.  The Second Renaissance is a two-part film written and directed by Mahiro Maeda. He used Bits and Pieces of Information written by the The Wachowskis as a prequel to the series as a base for the first part. With increasing numbers of people released from all labor, the human population has become lazy, arrogant, and corrupt. Despite this, the machines were content with serving humanity and, as the narrator states, \"for a time, it [the status quo] was good\". This phrase is a reference to one of the most famous phrases of Genesis, consistent with the Biblical references seen throughout the original Matrix films, and is one of numerous references to Genesis in particular present in \"Second Renaissance\". The relationship between humans and machines changes in the year 2090, when a domestic android is threatened by its owner. The android, named B1-66ER in what appears to be a reference to the character Bigger Thomas from the novel Native Son, then kills the owner, his pets, and a mechanic instructed to deactivate the robot. This murder is the first incident of an artificially intelligent machine killing a human. B1-66ER is arrested and put on trial, but justifies the crime as self-defense, stating that it \"simply did not want to die\". During the trial scene, there is a voice-over of Clarence Darrow  quoting a famous line from the Dred Scott v. Sandford case in 1856 in his closing statement, which implicitly ruled that African Americans were not entitled to citizenship under United States law. Using this as a precedent, the prosecution argues that machines are not entitled to the same rights as human beings, and specifically that human beings have a right to destroy their property, while the defense urges the listener not to repeat history, and to judge B1-66ER as a human and not a machine . {{quote}} B1-66ER loses the court case and is destroyed. Across the industrialized world, mass civil disturbances erupt when robots and their human sympathizers rise in protest. World leaders fear a robot rebellion, and governments across the planet initiate a major program to destroy all humanoid machines. News reports show rioting in American and Western European cities such as Chicago and Berlin, alongside the peaceful \"Million Machine March\" on the Albany district courthouse where B1-66ER was sentenced. Visual references are made to such incidents as General Nguy·ªÖn Ng·ªçc Loan's execution of Viet Cong officer Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn L√©m, the Tank Man standoff following the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, the Al-Aqsa Intifada and The Holocaust. Some robots escape destruction when humans, in their greed, still want the robots to work and produce things for them. The machine population is exiled, and they create their own nation in the Middle East, named Zero One . According to the narrator, the robots built Zero One in \"the cradle of human civilization\", an allusion to the Fertile Crescent, apparently located in Saudi Arabia's \"Empty Quarter\" which is devoid of human life. Essentially ghettoized at Zero One, the machines establish their own industrial base there and begin to produce efficient, highly advanced artificial intelligence, echoing Vernor Vinge's thoughts on a technological singularity. The new nation excels at manufacturing high-tech consumer products, and before long, Zero One's consistent export of cheap, reliable, mass-produced goods begin to undercut the global economy. The United Nations Security Council calls an emergency economic summit at UN headquarters in New York City, resulting in UN delegates approving of a global economic blockade of Zero One that echoes the Cuban Missile Crisis. Two robotic ambassadors, built as a mechanical Adam and Eve, are sent by the leaders of Zero One to peacefully request the admission of their state to the United Nations as a prelude to settling the economic crisis peacefully. Despite their peaceful intentions, the ambassadors are forcibly removed from the chamber, and their application is rejected. As this scene unfolds, the narrator states that \"this was not the last time the machines would take the floor there\" foreshadowing the end of Part II. Part I ends as the Security Council debates the issue of short-sightedly declaring war on the Machine Empire.  Part II opens with United Nations aircraft unleashing a massive nuclear bombardment on Zero One. The nuclear carpet bombing devastates the machine city, but is unsuccessful in destroying many elements of the mechanical population, given that the machines did not have the same weaknesses to the bombs' fallout and heat as humans. The machines retaliate by unleashing their armies to conquer neighboring human countries, triggering a world war between the United Nations and Zero One. Unfortunately, most of the world's industrial output is already based in Zero One, as the lazy humans had grown accustomed to not producing things for themselves. Despite their best efforts, human troops are unable to hold back Zero One's relentlessly efficient onslaught, and slowly retreat . As the machine forces push deeper across the planet, military leaders begin to pursue increasingly desperate solutions. At a summit of political and military leaders from around the world, unanimous approval is given to a plan code-named \"Operation Dark Storm\", which aims to cut the machines off from the sun, their primary energy source. The plan is executed in 2095, with high altitude bombers dispersing sky-darkening nanomachines into the air, while the human armies simultaneously launch a ground offensive against the machine forces. The plan is initially successful, although many of the human nations' long-range weapons systems are also disabled by the lack of sunlight. With their high-tech weapons rendered useless, human commanders are forced to launch close-quarters infantry engagements, supported by electromagnetic artillery fire and armored assaults using atomic tanks and powered armor. Heavy losses are taken on both sides, but the Machines gradually gain the upper hand. Legions of a new model of machine, no longer in humanoid form and appearing more like the insectoid or cephalopod-like Sentinels and others of the Matrix films, overrun the human armies. This coincides with the destruction of original man-made robots at the hands of human forces and, as a result, the further dehumanization of the rapidly emerging machine collective. As the machine armies swarm across the human defenses, the United Nations, in desperation, fires nuclear missiles directly at the machine armies, vaporizing their own troops in the process. To make up for the lack of solar power, the machines begin capturing human prisoners and using their bodies to power large biomechanical tanks, which quickly cut through the dwindling human artillery. As the expanding armies of Zero One overrun Eurasia, they unleash lethal biological weapons which further ravage humanity. Eventually brought to its knees by the might of the machine army, the Security Council calls a global summit at U.N. headquarters to sign an armistice and end the war. Zero One's machine ambassador signs the peace treaty with a barcode, in which the humans agree to surrender their remaining territories to the machines. \"Your flesh is a relic, a mere vessel. Hand over your flesh and a new world awaits you. We demand it\" are the only words the machine utters before it detonates a nuclear bomb in the meeting chamber, killing most of the planet's leaders and destroying New York City, one of the few remaining human settlements. In 2102, the machines crush the leaderless remnants of the human armies, and the war ends. Zero One is victorious, but it is a Pyrrhic victory: the planet has been devastated by the war and by the crippling ecological impact of the Dark Storm shroud, which the machines are unable to remove. In need of a new energy source, the machines adapt their bioelectric tank technology to build vast human-stocked power stations, using their bodies' waste-energy to catalyze a powerful fusion reaction, in which in its making the Humans endure many days of agonising torture, and at its completion, the Machines create the computer-generated virtual reality of the Matrix , to keep their prisoners sedated by feeding the virtual world into the prisoners' brains, starting with the first prototype Matrix .  Kid's Story was written by the The Wachowskis and directed by Shinichiro Watanabe, with animations by Kazuto Nakazawa and production design by Studio 4¬∞C, Tokyo. It is the only one of the animated shorts contained in The Animatrix in which Neo appears. The short takes place during the six month gap between The Matrix and The Matrix: Reloaded, during which time Neo has joined the crew of the Nebuchadnezzar and is helping the rebels to free other humans from the Matrix. Kid  is a disaffected teenager who feels there is something wrong with the world, frequenting hacker chatrooms on the internet and wondering if he is alone. In school, he absent-mindendly scribbles \"Neo lives\" in his notebook. One day he receives a personal invitation from Neo  to escape the Matrix . The following day, he receives a call from Neo on his cell phone, and is chased through his high school by a band of Agents, before ultimately being cornered on the roof. He asserts his faith in Neo, and throws himself from the roof, whereupon the other characters are shown holding his funeral. The short fades up from black as the Kid awakens in the real world to see Neo and Trinity watching over him. They remark that he has achieved \"self substantiation\" , which was considered impossible. In both the short itself and The Matrix Reloaded, however, the Kid seems to believe it was Neo's actions, not his own, that saved him. Self-substantiation is never thoroughly discussed in any part of the series. Morpheus speaks of the founder of Zion who freed himself, presumably without external help. However, this was revealed to be a ruse by the machines. Kid's Story and World Record both heavily hint at this as the viewer wonders how a man being awoken from one of those pods, apparently helpless, could somehow build and start a city.  Program was written and directed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri. The character designs were done by Yutaka Minowa. In case with Beyond and Matriculated it is also a midquel of the first or second film. It follows the protagonist, \"Cis\" , who is engaged in her \"favorite simulation\": a battle program set in feudal Japan. After successfully eliminating an attacking enemy cavalry, a lone samurai appears whom Cis recognizes as \"Duo\" . \"Cis\" made her first appearance as an image in The Matrix Revisited. Initially, the two duel as allies, testing one another's fighting abilities. During the course of their duel, Duo briefly disarms Cis. He questions her concentration and wonders whether she regrets taking the Red Pill that took them out of the \"peaceful life of the virtual world\". They continue fighting until she finally overpowers Duo and is poised for the 'kill'. It is at this point that Duo states that he has \"something to say\". She sarcastically assumes that he wants to propose [marriage]; but instead he admits a desire to return to the Matrix; incredulous, Cis nevertheless responds that doing so is impossible as 'the truth' is already known to them, forbidding their re-integration. Duo reasons that reality is harsh and that he is tired of it. He adds that the Machines can make the both of them forget the truth. Duo then states that he has disabled or killed the other crewmembers and contacted the Machines. He asks Cis to return with him to the Matrix, but she continues to refuse. As Duo becomes more aggressive in his arguments for returning, Cis attempts to escape while simultaneously warding off his attacks. Becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the situation, Cis requests an operator in order to exit the simulation. Duo tells her that no one can hear her and reiterates that it \"is already done...[the machines] are on their way\". Thereafter their fighting becomes much more serious and forceful as they move from rooftop to rooftop. Duo, in a flying leap, attacks her from above with his sword. As the blade comes towards her, Cis, standing her ground, concentrates and halts its forward motion inches from her face and breaks it. She takes the broken end of the blade and thrusts it into Duo. Duo states his love for her as he dies. Suddenly, she wakes from the program and discovers that the encounter with Duo was a test program devised for training purposes. A man named \"Kaiser\"  unsuccessfully assures her that she acted appropriately during the test and met the test's targets. Clearly upset, she punches him in the face and walks away. He remarks that \"aside from that last part\", she passed the test.  World Record was created by Madhouse and directed by Takeshi Koike, with a screenplay by Yoshiaki Kawajiri and is also a midquel of the first or second film. The beginning of this short includes a short narration from the Instructor  explaining details behind the discovery of the Matrix by \"plugged-in\" humans. Only exceptional humans tend to become aware of the Matrix, who have \"a rare degree of intuition, sensitivity, and a questioning nature\", all qualities which are used to identify inconsistencies in the Matrix. This is not without exceptions, given that \"Some attain this wisdom through wholly different means.\" The story is about Dan Davis, a track athlete, who's competing in the 100m in the Summer Olympic Games. He has set a world record time of 8.99 seconds, but his subsequent gold medal was revoked for drug use. He decides to compete again and break his own record to \"prove them wrong.\" Despite support from his father and a young reporter, Dan's trainer tells him that he is physically unfit to race and that pushing himself too hard will cause a career ending injury. Dan is adamant on racing. On the day of the race, he is monitored by 4 agents located in the stadium. The race begins and Dan starts off strong. However, the muscles in his leg violently rupture, putting him at a setback and scaring many of the people in the stands. Through strong willpower, Dan ignores the injury and runs much faster than he did before, easily passing the other athletes. Before he can cross the finish line, 3 of the agents possess the 3 closest runners and try and stop him, but even they can't catch up to him. Dan's massive burst of energy in the Matrix causes his real-world counterpart  to rip apart the plug connecting him to the Matrix, causing him to see the real world through his pod. A Sentinel restrains him back in his pod and violently shocks him with electrified restraints. Dan's mind is thrown back into the Matrix, but his body is exhausted from the race and what he has just seen, causing him to tumble to the ground at high speeds. Despite this, Dan easily won the race and broke his original time of 8.99 seconds with a time of 8.72 seconds. The next scene shows a crippled Dan being wheeled by a nurse through a hospital. A nearby agent calls his other agents to tell them that they erased Dan's memory of the race and that he will never walk again; he won't be an issue. However, Dan quietly whispers the word, \"Free,\" angering the agent and telling him to sit back down. Davis then breaks free of the restraints in his wheelchair and takes a few steps before falling down again and being helped up by the nurse.  Beyond is written and directed by Koji Morimoto. It is a midquel short film, during the first or second installment of the trilogy. It follows a teenage girl, Yoko , looking for her cat Yuki. While asking around the neighborhood, indicatively somewhere in Japan, she meets some younger boys. One of them tells her Yuki is inside a \"haunted house\" and invites her to see it. The children have stumbled across an amalgamation of anomalies within an old, dilapidated building. They have learned to exploit this glitch in the Matrix for their own enjoyment, through several areas which seem to defy real-world physics: glass bottles reassemble after being shattered, rain falls from a sunny sky, broken lightbulbs flicker briefly , a door which opens into an endless dark void, shadows which do not align with their physical origins, and a dove's feather that rotates rapidly in place in mid-air. There is a large open space in the middle of the run-down building where they take turns jumping off a high point and falling towards the ground, yet somehow stopping inches before impact. This proves amusing and they do not seem to be bothered by the inherent strangeness of the place. Throughout the film, brief sequences show that Agents are aware of the problem in the Matrix, and a truck is seen driving toward the site to presumably deal with the problem. It arrives while the children are still playing, and an Agent-led team of \"rodent exterminators\" moves in to clear everybody out of it. The story ends when Yoko and the others return to the area the next day and find the site has been turned into an unremarkable parking lot. They unsuccessfully attempt to re-create the bizarre occurrences of yesterday and soon go in search of something else to do.  A Detective Story is written and directed by Shinichiro Watanabe, with animation by Kazuto Nakazawa and is a direct prequel to the first film. It follows the story of a down-on-his-luck private detective, Ash , on what he calls the \"case to end all cases\". Ash receives an anonymous phone call to search for a hacker that goes by the alias \"Trinity\" . Ash traces Trinity and learns that other detectives have failed in the same task before him; one had committed suicide, one had gone missing, and one had gone insane. He then attempts to speak with the insane detective but cannot get anything substantial out of him. This detective is an African American with a thin mustache who shows a resemblance to Walter Mosley's detective character 'Ezekiel \"Easy\" Rawlins'. This is a possible homage to the character as Mosley's detective series is set in a similar Noir type setting and there were not many black detectives at the time. Eventually Ash finds Trinity after deducing that he should communicate using phrases and facts from Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. She proposes a meeting, and he successfully finds the location. At the meeting she removes a \"bug\" from his eye, planted by Agents earlier in an \"eye exam dream\". Agents appear and attempt to apprehend Trinity in a shoot-out with her and Ash. While the two fugitives are trying to escape the train, an Agent attempts to take over Ash's body, forcing Trinity to shoot him in order to prevent the Agent from appearing. Ash is wounded, whereupon he and Trinity bid farewells without malice. Trinity escapes, telling Ash that she thinks he could have handled the truth. Agents enter the car to find Ash, who points his gun at them while looking in the other direction and lighting a cigarette. The Agents turn to Ash who, even though he is armed, will likely die. With this apparent no-win situation, the film ends with Ash's line  as his lighter flame goes out.Easy Rawlins  {{Redirect}} Matriculated was written and directed by Korean American director Peter Chung, widely known for his work on Aeon Flux. Like Beyond, it is a midquel of the first or second film. The film deals with a group of above-ground human rebels who lure hostile intelligent machines to their laboratory in order to capture them and insert them into a \"matrix\" of their own design. Within this matrix, the humans attempt to teach the captured machines some of the positive traits of humanity, primarily compassion and empathy. The ultimate goal of this project is to help the intelligent machines develop free will in order to overcome their original \"search-and-destroy\" programming, rather than reprogramming it by force. The rebels' hope is that, once converted of its own volition , an \"enlightened\" machine will assist Zion in its struggle against the machine-controlled totalitarianism which currently dominates the Earth. After capturing one of the \"runner\" robots, the rebels insert the machine into their matrix. The experience of the robot leads it to believe it may have a relationship with one of the female rebels, Alexa , either friendship or something deeper. However, the rebel group is attacked by the Machines and unplug themselves to defend their headquarters, but they experience what might be considered a Pyrrhic Victory: all the onscreen rebels are killed but the single robot captured in the film successfully 'reprogrammed', indicated by the machine's mechanical eye changing from red to green. The robot plugs the dying Alexa into their matrix with itself, the only two things left surviving. Much to the machine's dismay, when the rebel realizes she is trapped inside the matrix with the \"friendly\" robot, she turns horrified and her avatar dissolves screaming as she clutches her head, and the robot exits from the rebels' matrix to see a motionless Alexa in front of him in the real world. The film ends with the 'converted' robot standing outside the headquarters of the human rebels, with a light on its back now turned back to the color red.

The short is a direct prequel leading into the events of The Matrix Reloaded. Thadeus , a muscular man and an athletic woman called Jue  engage in a blindfolded sword fight in a virtual-reality dojo. With each slice of their swords, they remove another piece of each other's clothing. Immediately after cutting the other down to their underwear, they lift their blindfold to peek at the other. As the two are about to kiss, they are interrupted by an alarm and the virtual reality simulation ends. In the next scene, the hovercraft Osiris is headed for Junction 21 when Robbie , the operator, picks up thousands of Sentinels on his HR scans. The ship flees into an uncharted tunnel, where it encounters another group of Sentinels patrolling the area. The crewmembers man the guns onboard and destroy the patrol. The ship then emerges on the surface, four kilometers directly above Zion and close to the army of Sentinels previously detected in the scan. Alerted to the Osiris's presence, the army of Sentinels pursue the ship. Captain Thadeus decides Zion must be warned, and his shipmate Jue volunteers to broadcast herself into the Matrix to deliver the warning while the ship is doggedly pursued. Jue and Thadeus admit to peeking at each other in the VR simulation. Entering the Matrix on a high rooftop, Jue jumps off and acrobatically makes her way down through structure work between two buildings. When she hits the ground in the alley below, a ripple effect is created by her impact. She drops off a package into a mail box. The package sets the prologue for Enter the Matrix. She attempts to contact Thadeus via a cell phone as the Osiris are overcome by Sentinels and crash. The Sentinels tear their way into the ship. At the time of the call, Thadeus is making a last stand to hold off the Sentinels. Shortly after Jue says \"Thadeus\" over her cell phone, the Osiris explodes, destroying many of the pursuing Sentinels. In the Matrix, Jue falls to the ground, dead, her body having been destroyed on the ship.\n","\n","    ### Response: 2003\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the details of the movie and the plot summary and idenitfy which movie is being described.\n","\n","    ### Context:\n","    Film Genre:['Action', 'Comedy'], Starring the actors: information not available, Released in the year: 1990, Summary of the movie plot: Gnorm is just an average gnome, but he wants to impress the lady Gnomes by doing something heroic.

Eva's death is announced in a movie theater and a public funeral is held in Buenos Aires. Che , an everyman, narrates the story of Eva's rise to power and later illness and death, appearing in many different guises and serving as Eva's conscience and critic. As a young child, Eva attempts to attend her father's funeral in the town of Jun√≠n with her mother and siblings. Despite her father's wife and other family denying her family from entering, Eva pays her last respects to her father. Years later, Eva decides to leave Jun√≠n to seek a better life in Buenos Aires with a tango singer, Agust√≠n Magaldi , with whom she is having an affair. After Magaldi leaves her, she progresses through several relationships with increasingly influential men, becoming a model, actress and radio personality, until her fateful meeting with Colonel Juan Per√≥n  at a fundraiser. Per√≥n's connection with Eva lends him a populist air, since she is from the working class . Eva has a radio show during Per√≥n's rise and uses all her skills to promote Per√≥n, even when the controlling administration has him jailed in an attempt to stunt his political momentum. The groundswell of support Eva generates forces the government to release Per√≥n, and he finds the people enamored of him and Eva.

While there she gets mixed receptions from the people; the people of Spain adore her; the people of Italy call her whore and throw things (such as [[Egg  at her, while the Pope gives her a small, meager gift; and the French, while kind to her were also upset that she was forced to leave early as \"she seemed to lose interest, she seemed tired\"; . Upon returning to Argentina, Eva establishes a foundation and distributes aid while the Per√≥nists otherwise plunder the public treasury. Argentine society is very class-based, and the military officer corps and social elites despise Eva's common roots and affinity for the poor. However, over time, as Eva's illness begins to worsen, she is hospitalized and told she is terminally ill. Eventually, as her illness progresses, she declines the position of Vice President she was offered and makes one final broadcast to the people of Argentina. Towards the end of her life, she understands that her life was short because she shone like the \"brightest fire\" and helps Per√≥n prepare to go on without her. A large crowd surrounds the Casa Rosada in a candlelight vigil praying for her recovery when the light of her room goes out, signifying her death. Eva's funeral is shown again. Ch√© is seen at her coffin, laying the blame of her death on Per√≥n.

McGinley', 'Miranda Otto', 'John Cusack', 'John Savage', 'Drake Bell', 'Glenn Morshower', 'Kurt Fuller', 'L. Q. Jones', 'Rodney A. Grant'], Released in the year: 1999, Summary of the movie plot: The Jack Bull is about a normal Horse trader Myrl Redding  who cherishes the law and his rights. He lives a normal life with his son, Cage , his wife Cora  and his good friends. However he clashed one day with Land Baron Henry Ballard  over Wyoming's bid for statehood. If Wyoming remains a territory Henry Ballard can continue to buy more land and eventually evict its residents, however if Wyoming becomes a state then his rights to the land will be restricted. After further conflict with Ballard, Redding attempts to take his horses to a horse market in Casper. However he encounters Ballard, who has built a tollgate that blocks the road to Casper, charging a fee for passage. Redding realizes going around would take too long to get the horses to market on time, with the market closed before he could arrive. Ballard tells Redding that he will allow Redding to cross with a fee of ten dollars. Redding gives him five and leaves two black stallions as collateral for the other five. He also leaves his Indian friend and worker Billy to make sure the horses are not mistreated. Redding arrives at Casper on time and sells his horses, with the exception of the two he left behind and makes his way back to his home. He stops for his horses and finds Billy is missing and his horses are starved, diseased, beaten, and near death. He beats one of Ballard's henchmen and demands that his horses be returned healthy and fed. Ballard says he'll never do it and Redding leaves, saying he has two weeks to comply with his demands. Ballard ignores him and returns to his normal life. Redding returns home and finds Billy beaten and bitten. Billy describes how one of Ballard's henchmen had the two horses chained to a wagon of logs and was beating them when they rested even though they had been working for hours. Billy attempted to stop him but he was attacked by two other henchmen who then set the dogs on him. He said he was forced to flee and would've been killed if he had returned. Redding agrees with Billy and sympathizes with him, telling him it was not his fault for what happened to the horses. He departs that day for the local town and approaches the local lawyer and asks for legal help. The lawyer tells Redding he will probably not win because it is an Indian's word against a wealthy white man's. Redding says to do it anyway and leaves after paying ten dollars in lawyer fees. A week passes and nothing happens, and Redding tells his lawyer to speed up the case. The lawyer intercepts Judge Wilkins, the local judge, on the way to the barber and pleads for a chance to make their case. Wilkins, who has a financial interest in Ballard's business, tells them that he is throwing the case out and advises the lawyer to choose his clients more carefully, stating \"You're shoveling shit out of the mountain.\" The lawyer informs Redding about Judge Wilkins decision and after his wife finds out she tells Redding that she is good friends with the District Attorney's wife, and she departs for Casper to plead their case before the D.A. She and Woody, Redding's trusted friend, depart for Casper and he drops her off in front of the D.A.'s office. When she arrives at the office she is informed she needs an appointment and she reluctantly leaves after leaving her name. However unknown to her two of Ballard's henchmen had beaten Woody and thrown him into a carriage, knocking the driver off. The wild carriage runs her over as she is crossing the street, making her death a very unfortunate coincidence caused by Ballard's men. Woody gives the documented complaint against Ballard directly to the D.A., who emerges to see what has happened. Woody then drives Cora's body back to Myrl's household where they bury her. To make matters worst Redding's lawyer returns with news that the D.A. has sent the case back to Judge Wilkins, who has once again thrown the case out. Redding, distraught with the loss of his wife and realizing that the justice system will do nothing to stop Ballard, takes justice into his own hands and rallies the local farmers against Ballard. Although some have doubts he talks them into joining him with the offer that he will pay each man who joins him fifteen dollars a month. Redding and his new militia of farmers ride towards Ballard's house where they route Ballard's men and Ballard himself flees for his life for Casper. Redding burns down Ballard's stable and leaves for the local town, looking for Ballard. After questioning a local farmer who refuses to tell them Ballard's location, he burns down the farmer's barn and leaves the barn smoldering. They then ride to a local Amish community and threaten to burn down the houses if they hide Ballard or refuse to give them the location. After the Amish people tell him they don't even know Ballard, he asks for a person who knows how to print. They find one and offer him fifteen dollars to mass produce fliers demanding Ballard that he has a week to get the horses fed and healthy. Ballard meanwhile, had reached Casper and pleads for help from the Governor of Wyoming himself. The Governor offers protection and charges the Sheriff to find and arrest Redding. But after only a day of searching, the Sheriff is ambushed during the night and during a brief struggle Redding kills one of Ballard's men, Slater, after he attempts to shoot Billy. He forces the sheriff at gunpoint to say that it was self defense, and after Redding departs the Sheriff returns to Casper and tells news that Slater was shot dead by Redding. Meanwhile Billy, while riding back to Ballard's house is shot by its caretaker Conrad. After a brief firefight Conrad shoots his wife by accident and Billy and Redding leave. Meanwhile the Governor, after conversing with Judge Joe B. Tolliver  and the Attorney General decides to offer Redding amnesty if he turns himself in. Redding accepts but Billy doesn't, saying that land Ballard took belonged to his native tribe. Billy leaves and Redding arrives in Casper to participate in the trial of Henry Ballard. During the trial however the D.A.'s assistant informs them that Judge Wilkins is charging Redding with two counts of murder and armed insurrection. However the amnesty agreement was typed before the charges were sent, putting the Governor in a bind. If he charges Redding, he will break the amnesty agreement, but if he doesn't charge Redding, he will be violating a judge's charges. The governor decides he will charge Redding if he breaks the amnesty agreement. The trial ends after several witnesses testify that the horses were indeed healthy stallions although Ballard testifies otherwise. Judge Tolliver agrees with Redding and orders Ballard to restore the horses to their previous health. Meanwhile, Billy has sued Ballard for the land rights but is losing, so he sends a messenger to Redding in an attempt to gain leverage over Ballard. Redding writes a letter of support but the messenger is ambushed while leaving Redding's hotel. The letter is used as proof to show Redding has violated his amnesty and he is charged with two counts of murder and armed insurrection. He is found guilty one one count of murder and armed insurrection at the same time that Billy and his Indians are ambushed by the Wyoming Army. Redding is sentenced to be hung and Ballard is charged with perjury for lying under oath and sentenced to two years in jail, three months of which will be spent restoring the two stallions' health. Further consequence is that Ballard will lose his life savings. On the day of the hanging Redding meets with his son and tells him to always work hard and never give up. After a heartfelt goodbye Redding is called to inspect the two horses. After confirming that they have been restored, Ballard curses him and claims Redding got nothing from Ballard. Redding replies simply, \"You did what I said you would.\" Ballard is carried away screaming and Redding is marched to the gallows. Judge Tolliver, who seems compassionate toward Redding and his principles, finds Judge Wilkins in a bar. Tolliver angrily berates him for charging an innocent man with murder. He then says that he has sent a letter to the governor asking for a committee, that he'll oversee, to review Wilkins' ability to be a judge, and says he hopes they will find him unable. Judge Wilkins, obviously distraught, attempts to order a drink, to which the bartender replies, \"Ten dollars a shot\", mocking the judge about how Ballard charged Redding ten dollars to cross the land and how Wilkins did nothing about it. The bartender leaves Wilkins miserable and dishonored. Redding walks to the gallows but not before being hugged by his son and another heartfelt goodbye. He is hung and various clips show. One is of his son, Cage and Woody leading the two stallions along with Redding's body away from the city back home. Another shows the Wyoming marching band parading down the street announcing Wyoming has become a state.\n","\n","    ### Response: 100 Proof\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the details of the movie and the plot summary and idenitfy which movie is being described.\n","\n","    ### Context:\n","    Film Genre:['Comedy'], Starring the actors: ['Naima Akef', 'Emad Hamdy', 'Abdel Aziz Mahmoud', 'Zeinab Sedky', 'Faten Hamama'], Released in the year: 1949, Summary of the movie plot: Elham  marries Nabil  and moves with him to his mother's house, which is where problems arise between Elham and her mother-in-law.

His 19-year-old son Marius works for him at his bar, but wants nothing more than to go to sea and leave his boring existence behind. The only thing holding him back is Fanny, an 18-year-old girl with whom he grew up. Fanny works selling fish with her mother down at the waterfront. Fanny has been in love with Marius her whole life, and flirts with him, but Marius always rejects her. Fanny invites Marius to a Sunday night dance, but he rejects her once more. Unbeknownst to Fanny, Marius is planning to leave the next day, having secretly signed on as a sailor on a lengthy scientific expedition traveling around the world after being encouraged to do so by his friend known as the Admiral. Fanny is offended and leaves. Meanwhile, elderly but wealthy merchant Panisse asks to meet with Fanny's mother Honorine, who believes he wants to propose to her. To her surprise, he wants to marry Fanny, even though he knows she loves someone else. Although disappointed, Honorine does not object, seeing as Panisse is worth 600,000 francs. Fanny tells Marius she has rejected Panisse's proposal because she loves him and is willing to wait until he returns. Marius tells her he will be away for five years and to forget about him. They declare their love for each other and go to Fanny's house, which is empty while her mother is away. The following morning, Honorine discovers Fanny and Marius in bed together. She and C√©sar begin to plan their children's wedding, but Fanny urges Marius to leave, even lying to him, telling him that she would rather marry a rich man like Panisse than she would him. But, in truth, she is fearful he eventually will grow to hate her for depriving him of this great opportunity. Around two months after Marius goes off to sea, Fanny discovers she is pregnant with Marius's child and tells Panisse the news. He is happy to marry her anyway, overjoyed with the possibility of a male heir to carry on his name. They marry and Fanny gives birth to a boy to whom C√©sar is godfather. C√©sar, knowing the baby's true father, collaborates with Panisse to give the baby the name C√©sario Marius Panisse. On C√©sario's first birthday, Panisse leaves on the train to Paris on business, and while he is gone, Marius returns on a short leave. He visits Fanny, and upon learning her child is his, apologizes to Fanny, as he knows now she said those things only to make him go. Marius tells her that he wants her back, but then C√©sar comes in before anything can happen. Panisse then arrives home early and says that he will not try to stop Fanny from leaving with Marius but he will not part with the child, knowing that Fanny won't leave without the boy. Fanny tells Marius she loves him but will not take C√©sario from Panisse, as it was Panisse who had been there for Fanny and C√©sario all along. C√©sar advises his son the father is \"the one who loves,\" and Panisse loves this child and has been a wonderful father to him. Marius then departs with neither Fanny nor his child. Ten years later, C√©sario is looking forward to his birthday party. After being taken to the waterfront with Fanny's mother, C√©sario wanders off and meets the Admiral. The Admiral takes the boy sailing without telling anyone and reunites him with Marius, though C√©sario has no idea who Marius is. Marius, who is now working in a garage, is overjoyed to see his son, but when Panisse is told the boy is missing, he is stricken and taken to his room. Fanny finds C√©sario with his father and is shocked. She announces that Panisse is dying and Marius drives them home to the dying Panisse. When they arrive at the house, Panisse calls for C√©sario to sit with him, leaving Fanny and Marius together. Fanny explains to Marius she never told him about the baby because she fully expected him to take her with him and, when he didn't, she felt betrayed and was angry. Fanny then goes to Panisse and as he lies dying, Panisse dictates a letter asking Marius to marry his wife once he is dead, and be a father to C√©sario; his only request being that the boy keep his last name.\n","\n","    ### Response: 1001 Nights\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the details of the movie and the plot summary and idenitfy which movie is being described.\n","\n","    ### Context:\n","    Film Genre:['Short Film', 'Drama'], Starring the actors: ['Riitta Elstel√§', 'Marja Packal√©n', 'Peter Franz√©n', 'Kari V√§√§n√§nen', 'Tuula Nyman', '√Öke Lindman', 'Pertti Sveholm', 'Jani Karvinen', 'Tauno Satomaa', 'Ossi Lehtinen', 'Maria J√§rvenhelmi', 'Anni Koskinen', 'Ossi Koskinen', 'Merja Pietil√§', 'Heli Sirvi√∂', 'Helena R√§ngman', 'Johannes Lahtela', 'Eeva-Riitta Heikkinen', 'Eero J√§rvinen', 'Pirjo-Riitta Forstr√∂m', 'Kari V√§√§n√§nen'], Released in the year: 2000, Summary of the movie plot: {{Expand section}} For the past years, 62-year-old Helmi has been taking care of her demanding mother.

Del Green ([[Donovan Leitch  is an honors student, highly motivated, who‚Äôs dream is to dance on the Perry Parker show with Vicky . Vicky is a the blond parochial school student, and the shows most popular dancer. One afternoon Del bets his school friends that he will indeed dance with ‚ÄòThe In Crowd‚Äô. The day he chooses happens to be Dugan‚Äôs  first day of banishment. He uses some trickery to get thru the stage door security goons and sneaks into the pre-show dressing room where the ‚Äòin crowd‚Äô muster. He‚Äôs new but not yet a threat to this self-centered group. Vicky shows up late. With the loss of their star male dancer, Dugan, Perry enters the dressing room with a ‚Äòheavy heart‚Äô and a need for one of the other boys to step up and replace Dugan as Vickie‚Äôs partner. Del jumps into the breach, combs his hair and gets a smile from Vicky, and threatening faces from the others. His first appearance is a big hit. TV cameras follow him and his more than adequate dancing with his smiling partner Vicky. The ‚Äòin crowd‚Äô now a bit jealous try to sabotage him during a line dance, but Dell dances his way out of harms way. His friends all watching from home can‚Äôt really believe that Del is so hip, cool and ‚Äòalive‚Äô while dancing. The shows audience of young teens really take a likening to Dell and aren‚Äôt a bit set back at Dugan‚Äôs demise. The show‚Äôs ratings go up and the management likes the new lead dancer, Del is a new member of the ‚ÄòIn Crowd‚Äô. Perry tells the cast to include Del in all their evening and daytime group outings, and Del agrees to even pick up Vicky at her home. Vicky agrees though she has ulterior motives. Del‚Äôs visits Vicky and her mom is in a cloud and sort of floats in time. Her is Tiny, a policeman and later is happy to see a smart college bound young man, a welcome change from Dugan. Del‚Äôs first evening, the group meets at the Germantown Train Station, Vicky sneaks away with Dugan, while the ‚ÄòIn Crowd‚Äô puts Del through a Miller beer shower initiation ceremony, an edgy, ruff experience that Del handles very well. Later Vicky returns, Del takes her home and Tiny forces her to give him a goodnight kiss. A good time was had by all. Del is now a full-fledged ‚ÄòIn Crowd‚Äô member. Next day, Perry Parker and a couple of his muscle men, disrupt Del‚Äôs American English Class where Perry ends up leading the discussion of a ‚ÄòTale of Two Cities‚Äô with the theme of ‚ÄòDying for Love‚Äô. Perry does a layman's rendition of the immensity of dying for love versus his teens just ‚Äòfeeling like they could die for love‚Äô. His thoughts impress the English teacher and show just how ‚Äòin tune‚Äô Perry is with his teens and his audience. Del is dragged out to the car to ogle the hundreds of adoring fan letters sent to him in care of the show. He is offered, ‚Äòpayola, extra money‚Äô for playing a bigger role in that day‚Äôs show. He gets to do the ‚ÄòLover‚Äôs Only‚Äô spotlight dance with Vicky, another big hit for the show and with the home fans and stage audience as well. There are several outings with the ‚ÄòIn Crowd‚Äô, one is on a Philly bus in the market area, lots of dancing, sight gags, teens being teens and the locals joining in with their own dance routines. Good scenes, somewhat in the tradition of the Beatles in a ‚ÄòHard Days Night‚Äô. Vicky and Del are pushed together by show bizz necessity, and they become close, but still there‚Äôs Dugan lurking and scheming in the background. A key daytime outing was to the boardwalk in Wildwood, New Jersey. We see Del and Vicky dressed in wedding costumes and being shown with the Wildwood teens going from business to business on the boardwalk. Perry melts down at a caricature of Dick Clark and has Morris  pay for the destruction of all the drawings. After a photo shoot at Carmines in their Tux and Wedding gown, Del and Vicky meet with the crowd of teens at the end of the pier. Here teens buy record albums so they can be part of a multiplication dance with Del and Vicky. During the middle of the song, Moon River, Del abandons his partner and walks over to invite a young girl to dance with him. She‚Äôs younger than the others, very pretty, dark hair, big eyes and a smile soon to melt everyone‚Äôs heart. She‚Äôs very shy, and doesn‚Äôt feel she can slow dance. She wears a leg brace and has an awkward limp. Del ignores her fear, takes her by both hands, walks to the center of the dance floor and starts dancing. Everyone is stunned at this generous and gracious dance offer by Del. Everyone stalls, stares and smiles at the dancing couple, some swoon. Del and his young partner lean into each other and she puts her head on his chest, smiles and becomes a magical dance partner. One beautifully happy girl becomes the perfect Wildwood teen, her smile seems as large as Del's heart. It‚Äôs a perfect dance scene, the music, the teens all vicariously dancing along with Dell and the young girl. Del returns Vicky home in the rain and at his home finds an open front door. Dugan is there, to challenge Del on his relationship with Vicki. He turns on the stereo, and they have a dance off right there in the living room, each trying to out dance the other, leaps, turning over the sofa, and tumbling off the walls. It ends in a stalemate where both fall back onto the sofa. Dugan opens up with his bigger than life plans to go to California and become a movie star. He struggles with the words in reading few paragraphs from a movie magazine, while Del listens and sees Dugan‚Äôs earnestness and desire to be a success. He also senses that Dugan is a good guy and well-meaning suitor for Vicky. Dugan really dreams of Vicky becoming another Natalie Wood, a dream both Vicky and he share. At the end of the visit, the two young men know what‚Äôs up, and Gail  his next door neighbor drops in for a visit and is roughly kissed by Dugan. He leaves and Gail tells Del that he‚Äôs hanging out with the ‚Äòwrong crowd‚Äô and is not going to make it into a good ivy league college, and by the way he is alienating his school friends. Del is caught in between the two worlds, his old friends and his more famous, edgy and exciting ‚ÄòIn Crowd‚Äô friends. Vicky invites Del over to work on her homework and he thinks it‚Äôs just another ruse to get out of the house and go on another date with Dugan. Turns out the she really wanted to work a bit on her school work and be with him not Dugan. More friction emerges in another date where Del takes Vicky to see Gail perform in her senior class play. At dinner after the play Vicky is humiliated by Gail and her dinner group when Vicky tells them that she is reading a piece of ‚Äòfriction‚Äô. Vicky doesn‚Äôt understand her error, but stands, excuses herself and pauses to tell Gail that she really enjoyed Gail‚Äôs performance in the play. A great cudo from her heart that catches the whole table by surprise. Del angrily leaves to find her. The British invasion has hurt the Perry Parker show ratings, so after he interviews a crude bunch of Brits, Perry goes ballistic. This turns out to be the last show, so Perry gives the ‚ÄòIn Crowd‚Äô instructions to cut loose, they dances wildly and are blacked out. Del takes out Vicky one more time with a borrowed car he gets through Gail. His plan was for Vicky to meet Dugan and run off to Hollywood, somehow Tiny gets wind of the plan and tries to stop the couple, Del crashes the borrowed Caddy into his police car to free Dugan and Vicky who make their escape on Dugan‚Äôs motorcycle. The last scene shows a grounded Del in his house. Gail comes by to play a new kind of music for him, Bob Dylan, while she wears a leather headband, mini-skirt and high top suede boots.He is stunned by her new appearance and can't take his eyes off of her. She feels connected to Del via the Dylan music/poetry, and Del finds solace in his re-ordered life. The two share a charged look, perhaps hinting of things to come.\n","\n","    ### Response: 10 to Midnight\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the details of the movie and the plot summary and idenitfy which movie is being described.\n","\n","    ### Context:\n","    Film Genre:['Documentary'], Starring the actors: information not available, Released in the year: 2012, Summary of the movie plot: The Eyes of Thailand tells the true story of Soraida Salwala's 10-year quest to help two elephant landmine survivors, Motala and Baby Mosha, walk again after losing their legs in landmine accidents.

He was jailed by the Vichy government on charges of desertion, but escaped from jail to join Charles de Gaulle's forces operating out of England, and later served as Prime Minister of liberated France. Part Two, The Choice, revolves around Christian de la Mazi√®re, who is something of a counterpoint to Mend√®s-France. Whereas Mend√®s-France was a French Jewish political figure who joined the Resistance, de la Mazi√®re, an aristocrat who embraced Fascism, was one of 7,000 French youth to fight on the Eastern Front wearing German uniforms. The film shows the French people's response to occupation as heroic, pitiable, and monstrous, sometimes all at once. The postwar humiliation of the women who served  Vichy men perhaps gives the strongest mix of all three.

Gigi started out as a thief, but because she fell for him and gave him immense luck, Andy gained great success with his extreme good luck in mahjong games and became very rich. However he refused to marry Gigi because she, though a nice woman when with him, was in reality quite a sore loser who threw temper tantrums while on the verge of losing mahjong games.

The lander carries two astronauts, one of them a black male model, James Washington, specifically chosen to aid the President of the United States in her re-election . Upon landing on the Far side of the Moon they encounter the Nazis who have hidden there since 1945. Washington is taken captive and the other astronaut killed. Nazi scientist Doktor Richter investigates Washington and finds his smartphone. Although initially skeptical, he recognizes that its computing power outstrips all their technology combined. Moreover it serves perfectly as a control unit for space battleship G√∂tterd√§mmerung. When he strives to demonstrate the completion of his Wunderwaffe to the current F√ºhrer, Wolfgang Kortzfleisch, the phone runs out of power. Nazi commander Klaus Adler, who is  chosen to mate with Earth specialist Renate Richter, Doktor Richter's daughter, offers to go to Earth to collect more phones. Adler takes a spacecraft to Earth, taking James with him, who has been bleached by Richter. Upon landing they find that Renate has stowed away and travelled with them. Meanwhile on Earth, the President of the United States has to tackle political issues; she desperately needs a miracle to ensure her re-election. Her aide, Vivian Wagner , introduces the Nazi couple to her. Adler and Richter go on to revamp the President's campaign Nazi-style, with apparent success, while the clueless Richter is unaware of Adler's ambition to become the next F√ºhrer and rule the world. After three months, Kortzfleisch seems to have figured out Adler's plan. He sends his armada  to Earth orbit. He himself lands on Earth and confronts Adler, but is consequently killed by him and Vivian. Adler declares himself the new F√ºhrer before he returns to orbit with Kortzfleisch's flying saucer. At the same time, Renate Richter comes across the now homeless Washington who makes her realise that terrestrial Nazis are not to her liking. The United Nations assemble to discuss the extra-terrestrial Nazi threat. The President is excited to finally have a war which will likely get her re-elected, and appoints Vivian Wagner as commander of the spacecraft USS George W. Bush, which orbits the Earth carrying nuclear weapons. As it turns out, most of the other nations have also developed armed spacecraft, and join in to defeat the invading Nazi armada. Back on Earth, Richter convinces Washington to come with her back to the Moon to stop Adler. They take Adler's flying saucer back to the Moon and to the G√∂tterd√§mmerung, where Washington attempts to disable the engines while Renate goes looking for Adler. Meanwhile, the international spacecraft armada has destroyed the Swastika moonbase and is heading for the G√∂tterd√§mmerung as well. In the final battle, Washington manages to disconnect the tablet device now controlling the G√∂tterd√§mmerung while Richter takes out Adler. The spaceship crashes into the Moon, but not before Adler has taken out a considerable chunk of the Moon attempting to get a clear shot at the Earth. The U.S. President calls Wagner from the UN session, congratulating her on her victory. Wagner discloses she detected large tanks of Helium-3 on the Moon. This material would keep the United States independent of foreign power sources for a millennium. Consequently the U.S. president immediately lays claim to it. This enrages a white-haired UN member  who throws his shoe at her. All UN members join the following \"meeting hall battle\". This leads to an international turmoil and eventually even the international spacecraft of the hitherto allied nations start attacking each other. Richter meets up with Washington  in the damaged Swastika moonbase, where they embrace in front of Richter's flabbergasted former students and some adults who have fled there from other parts of the base. Richter states that \"[they] have a lotta work cut out for [them]\". The final moments of the film show the Earth, where missiles are causing nuclear explosions across the globe. At the very end of the credits, the planet Mars is revealed with a man-made satellite of undetermined origin in orbit.\n","\n","    ### Response: √∂verlord\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the details of the movie and the plot summary and idenitfy which movie is being described.\n","\n","    ### Context:\n","    Film Genre:['Comedy-drama', 'Action/Adventure', 'Period piece', 'Drama', 'Comedy', 'War film', 'Action'], Starring the actors: ['Udo Kier', 'Nicolette Krebitz', 'James Cosmo', 'Karl Markovics', 'Matt LeBlanc', 'Eddie Izzard', 'David Tristan Birkin', 'Oliver Korittke', 'Elisabeth Judith Michaela Perlinger', 'Edward Fox'], Released in the year: 2001, Summary of the movie plot: During World War II the British army is attempting to retrieve an Enigma machine from Germany.

The four are sent to infiltrate the factory dressed as women. Dropped in the wrong area, the team must first try to find their bearings. Aided by Romy, a sympathiser to their cause, they find their way to the factory. They manage to retrieve the Enigma machine, against the expectations of the British army. Just before they leave Germany, they realize they were tricked &ndash; the British government already had the device, but wanted to make the Germans think they were still after it. They were specifically chosen as the team most likely to fail. That they are about to successfully leave Germany with an Enigma machine would, in fact, destroy the usefulness of the machine, as the Germans would know it was stolen and switch to a different code system. Archie volunteers to be captured with the machine to allow the mission to \"fail\". After he is captured, the team retrieves him and all return safely to England, leaving the German with the impression they have all the Enigma machines and the British are still desperate to obtain one.\n","\n","    ### Response: 51st State\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the details of the movie and the plot summary and idenitfy which movie is being described.\n","\n","    ### Context:\n","    Film Genre:['Thriller', 'Action/Adventure', 'Action'], Starring the actors: ['Sarah Ann Schultz', 'Cuba Gooding, Jr.', 'Christian Slater', 'Robert Giardina', 'Christa Campbell', 'Lochlyn Munro', 'Kelly Hyde', 'Al Madrigal', 'Tracy Schornick'], Released in the year: 2009, Summary of the movie plot: The film begins with self-help author Wes Wilson  who has recently come out with his first best selling book.

At breakfast, the older brothers, Jorge  and Sergio  argue with their father Humberto . The boys are studying at the university and their father works at the Departamento del Distrito Federal . The argument begins when the father complains that the boys have long hair. The argument escalates and then they begin to argue that what the boys are doing is wrong, and that \"no one should question the government\". The boys say that the autonomy of the university was violated and that the government does things against the constitution. Their grandfather Roque  , says that \"If they were on a real revolution, they would be executed\". The younger siblings Carlos  and Graciela , who study primary and secondary school, barely understand what the argument is all about, because of their young age. The boys then talk about the injustice of the government. Their prime example is the occupation of the U.N.A.M. and that some students hid in the bathroom, and their corpses were found the day before . The mother, Alicia  tries to calm down the situation and tells the boys to \"come early and cut their hair\". The boys jokingly state that Miguel Hidalgo had long hair , then leave. The day continues normally and then, while cooking, Alicia and Graciela argue about what the boys are doing. Graciela says that her mother is \"out of style\", then says that she would like to continue studying, to which her mother replies that she will end up being a homemaker anyway. Carlos is getting ready for school while listening to the Beatles, his grandfather complains that \"they're too loud\" and turns the radio off. Humberto tries to call his wife and tells her that \"something big is about to happen and that he is worried\", but before he can continue the phone dies. Alicia asks Graciela to go to the neighbor's apartment and try to call her father. Graciela does so and finds out that the neighbor's phone is dead. She returns and says that the phones do not work, \"neither ours, nor the neighbor's, nor the one in the corner\". Sometime later, the light goes out as well. Don Roque goes to the bottom floor and changes the fuse. He bumps into the neighbor on the way and they both change fuses. They then try to turn on the light and discover that the light got cut out. Don Roque then returns to the apartment and tells Alicia that the light does not work. They both worry and carry on with their day. Carlos returns from school. He tells his mother that he asked the teacher whether what his brothers said was true, and says the teacher confirmed it. He then goes outside to the building's hall to play with his toy soldiers with his grandfather. As they are playing, suspicious men with sniper rifles and white handkerchiefs in their left hands try to take a look through an opening on the hall. They find it \"inappropriate\" and go to upstairs floors. The two return to the apartment and Don Roque talks with his daughter about the military presence and the snipers at the roof of each building. Why? She asks. The answer is very simple: because they are prepared for something big. Alicia starts sewing something, Carlos does his homework and Don Roque tries to repair a watch. At the square outside, a crowd begins to gather. A student meeting is taking place. Carlos and Graciela watch the crowd and estimate more than 10,000 present. Graciela then goes to a friend's house to do her homework. After half an hour, the meeting is interrupted as red and green flares soar across the sky. Carlos sees this, excited, and tells his mom. Alicia peeks through the window and sees that the students are being slaughtered. Don Roque tells them to get away from the window and to hide in his room. As they do so, two bullets pierce the window. After some time, Don Roque tries to pick up Graciela, but before he does, he hears a sound. \"Tanks!\" he exclaims. Then it starts to rain. After some time, there are sounds from outside. The door opens and Serigio and Jorge  arrive, along with some mates. One of them, Luis , is wounded. Alicia tries to heal him, but he is bleeding badly. The shooting goes on and stops. During that time, the soaked students begin to trade stories. One of them says that he was on the building's third floor balcony, where the speech was being given, and said that armed people dressed as civilians yelled \"Olimpia Batallion! Nobody move!\". Another one says that he was leaving when the shooting started. The brothers say that the speaker yelled to the crowd \"not to fall on provocations\". Luis says that he was from the \"Poli\"  and was running with the crowd when he felt pain in his elbow, then found out he was shot, then afterwards lost his little sister. Another one claims that two dead children no older than 10 ended up on top of each other. A female student claims she saw the Plaza full of shoes. The students peek through the pierced window and see \"nothing but shadows\" . Don Roque arrives with Graciela and some soldiers, who are in the search for students. Don Roque says that he was a captain in the Revolution and searches for his papers. As he does so, the snipers come from upstairs holding three blood-soaked students. They punch them and then are told to \"take them with the others\". Don Roque comes back and gives his papers to the soldier, who tells them not to open to anyone. The old man goes back inside and says that the students were arrested and sent to military trucks, as well as that there were garbage trucks and firemen outside. Graciela says that they had to take the stairs and saw the elevator's doors pierced by bullets. Her mother says that it was practically impossible since they were \"made of thick steel\". The female student, who held the propaganda money, talks with Alicia. Alicia keeps the money on a jar until \"things get calm\", then says that the girl's parents would be worried, but the girl does not think so. Alicia says that it was impossible, \"by this time, the whole country is already aware of what happened here\", but the girl answers that \"not everything that the news says is true, and not everything that happens makes it into the news as well\". She goes into the bathroom to dry her soaked hair, when Graciela confronts her telling her \"to be a woman and not to be in Men Things\", to which the student replies \"this is a matter of both men and women\". Humberto calls and tells the family not to open to anyone. In a short time, some boys call their houses to assure their families they're OK. A second shooting ensues and the lights are shut down. The group sleeps and a woman starts crying outside looking for his son \"To√±o\". The students awake and ask if anyone is named To√±o. None of them is named like so. Finally, the lights come back on and Humberto arrives. He says that \"it was really hard to get past the security\". He also says that ambulances were on the surrounding area of the square, but none of them seemed to take the wounded to hospitals and that students were stripped and pushed to the bottom floor's elevator walls. One of the students asks whether they were being beaten up. Humberto confirms this harshly. They then turn the T.V. on and the local news says that the shooting took place because \"student snipers on the nearby buildings fired at the army, which was sent to support the police\". One of the students says the obvious: the government controls the local news as well, confirming the female student's claims. The group then goes to sleep, while the students plan their escape: the next day they'll \"leave the house one by one\". At the eerie sights of morning, the snipers bang on the door. After a harsh awakening, the students hide in the bathroom and one of them tells Humberto not to open. Carlos hides under his bed and the boys pretend to be asleep. Humberto asks who they are, but the snipers insist on opening. Humberto opens and the snipers act fiercely, pointing their guns at everyone. Humberto tells them of his position at the government, but they don't seem to care. They force everyone out of their beds and discover the boys' room full of leftist propaganda: \"The Communist Manifesto\" and a Che Guevara poster on their wall. They are forced to get out of their room and are asked if they were in on the meeting. Jorge answers, but Sergio does not and is pistol-whipped. They discover the bathroom is locked and Don Roque says Carlos is inside because he's scared. They then inspect the apartment because of the boys' leftist propaganda and find the blood-stained sheet on which Luis laid. Then they threaten to kill Humberto at gunpoint if the bathroom door does not open. Sergio, his mouth still full of blood, begs his mates to open the door. One of the snipers, meanwhile, shoots the doorknob of the bathroom and force everyone to leave. Some students stay put, while a student and the girl try to escape. Both are shot by the snipers. Other students also shout and are killed. A fight ensues. Jorge, Don Roque and Humberto try to over-power the snipers as Sergio and Graciela escape. The snipers win and shoot everyone. They then run to the hall to search for Sergio and Graciela. Two gunshots are heard. Carlos is the sole survivor as he gets out of his bed and sees the corpses in the hall. He starts to cry and goes barefoot down the blood-stained stairs. He sees his brother's corpse on the stairs with two bullet holes on his chest, then keeps walking down and finds his sister dead in at the foot of some stairs. He manages to get to the bullet-hit bottom floor and sees two soldiers, while in the background a government janitor  sweeps the floor, which contains student propaganda, finally the film ends.\n","\n","    ### Response: 10 October\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the details of the movie and the plot summary and idenitfy which movie is being described.\n","\n","    ### Context:\n","    Film Genre:['Parody', 'Thriller', 'Detective fiction', 'Horror', 'Detective', 'Black-and-white', 'Mystery', 'Comedy', 'Family Film', 'Slapstick'], Starring the actors: ['Bud Abbott', 'Boris Karloff', 'Lou Costello'], Released in the year: 1949, Summary of the movie plot: Prominent criminal attorney Amos Strickland  checks into the Lost Caverns Resort Hotel, and is later discovered murdered by the bellboy, Freddie Phillips , who is implicated in the crime. Casey Edwards , the house detective, tries to clear Freddie, but Inspector Wellman  and Sergeant Stone  keep him in custody. Seven of Strickland's former clients happen to be at the resort, and they are all suspects. These former clients are Swami Talpur , Angela Gordon , Mrs. Hargreave , T. Hanley Brooks , Lawrence Crandall , Mrs. Grimsby  and Mike Relia . They gather for a meeting, and decide that they must conceal their pasts and that Freddie must take the blame for Strickland's murder. They try unsuccessfully to get Freddie to sign a confession, e.g., Angela tries to seduce him, but the police stop her when they fear she's poisoned the champagne. Then the Swami attempts to hypnotize him into committing suicide, but his stupidity saves him. Freddie and the two police officers, in an attempt to lure the real killer, inform everyone that Freddie is in possession of a blood-stained handkerchief that was found at the murder scene. Soon afterwards, several attempts to kill Freddie are made, including gun shots at window of his booby trapped room, and locking him in a steam cabinet. Eventually Freddie hears a voice that calls him to bring the handkerchief to the Lost Cavern. There he meets up with a masked figure who offers to save him from the hole he has just fallen into in exchange for the handkerchief. Freddie makes the mistake of telling the mysterious figure that he left it in his room. He is left in the hole, but is eventually rescued by the two police officers. Back at the hotel, everyone has gathered together and Stone returns with some muddy shoes that belong to Melton , the hotel manager, which proves that he was the one in the caverns with Freddie.

Following the death of one of his workers in an accident, Plainview adopts the man's orphaned son. The boy, whom he names H. W. , becomes his nominal business \"partner\". Nine years later, Plainview is approached by Paul Sunday , who tells him about the oil deposit under his family's property in Little Boston, California. Plainview attempts to buy the farm at a bargain price but Paul's twin brother Eli , wise to Plainview's plan, holds out for $5,000, wanting the money to fund the local church, of which he is the pastor. Plainview has Eli's father agree to the bargain price instead, and goes on to acquire the available land in the area, except for one holdout, William Bandy . Oil production begins. Later, an on-site accident kills a worker, and later still, a large explosion robs H. W. of his hearing. One day, a visitor  arrives on Plainview's doorstep claiming to be his half-brother, Henry, seeking work. Plainview takes the stranger in, and though H. W. discovers flaws in his story, he keeps the news to himself; the boy then attempts to kill Henry by setting his bed linen alight. Angered at his son's behavior, Plainview sends the boy away to a school in San Francisco. A representative from Standard Oil offers to buy out Plainview's local interests, but Plainview elects to strike a deal with Union Oil and construct a pipeline to the California coast, though the Bandy ranch remains an impediment. After spending more time with Henry, Plainview also becomes suspicious; Henry confesses that he was actually a friend of the real Henry, who had died from tuberculosis. Plainview kills the imposter and buries his body. The next morning, Plainview is awakened by Mr. Bandy, who appears to be aware of the previous night's events. Bandy agrees to Plainview's deal but only on the provision that the latter mend his ways and join the Church of the Third Revelation, where Eli humiliates him as part of his initiation. Plainview soon reunites with H. W., and Eli eventually leaves town to perform missionary work. In 1927, a much older H. W.  marries his childhood sweetheart, Mary Sunday . By this time his father, now an alcoholic but extremely wealthy, is living in a mansion with only a servant for company. H. W. asks his father  to dissolve their partnership so he can establish his own business. Plainview mocks his son's deafness and tells him of his true origins, leaving H. W. with no regrets when he finally leaves. Eli, now a radio host and the head of a larger church, visits Plainview. Eli, in dire financial straits, explains that Mr. Bandy has died, and offers to broker a deal on his land. Plainview agrees to the deal if Eli confesses, \"I am a false prophet; God is a superstition\", subjecting Eli to the same humiliation Eli had put him through years earlier. Eli does so after much berating by Plainview. To Eli's horror, Plainview reveals that he had already drained the oil from the property through surrounding wells by saying, \"I drink your milkshake.\" Plainview suddenly goes into a rage, chases Eli about the room, and then beats him to death with a bowling pin. When Plainview's butler comes down to check on him, Plainview simply says \"I'm finished.\"\n","\n","    ### Response:  There Will Be Blood\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the details of the movie and the plot summary and idenitfy which movie is being described.\n","\n","    ### Context:\n","    Film Genre:['Crime Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Detective fiction'], Starring the actors: ['Patrick Macnee'], Released in the year: 1993, Summary of the movie plot: At the request of Inspector Lestrade , Sherlock Holmes  investigates a double murder at the Strand Theatre, with the assistance of Dr John Watson .\n","\n","    ### Response: 1895: A Year in the Life of Sherlock Holmes\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the details of the movie and the plot summary and idenitfy which movie is being described.\n","\n","    ### Context:\n","    Film Genre:['Silent film'], Starring the actors: ['Alice Joyce', 'Percy Marmont'], Released in the year: 1925, Summary of the movie plot: Julian  is a poor artist who lives with wife Edith  and their newborn baby in Harlem.

Carlito vows to be through with his criminal activities but is persuaded to accompany his young cousin Guajiro  to a drug deal held at a bar. Guajiro is betrayed and killed by his suppliers and Carlito is forced to shoot his way out. Afterwards, Carlito takes Guajiro's $30,000 from the botched deal and uses it to buy into a nightclub owned by a gambling addict named Saso  with the intent on saving $75,000 to retire to the Caribbean. As nightclub co-owner, Carlito declines several offers for a business partnership with an ambitious, albeit obnoxious, young gangster from the Bronx named Benny Blanco . Carlito also rekindles his romance with his former girlfriend Gail , a ballet dancer who moonlights as a stripper. Kleinfeld develops a love interest with Benny's girlfriend, Steffie, a waitress at Carlito's nightclub. Benny's frustration with Carlito's constant rejections boils over and he confronts Carlito one night at his table. Carlito publicly humiliates Benny, who reacts by manhandling Steffie. Fueled by his now extensive use of alcohol and cocaine, Kleinfeld brazenly pulls out a gun and threatens to kill Benny, but Carlito intervenes. Despite being personally threatened by Benny himself, Carlito lets Benny go unharmed; a decision which alienates Carlito's gangster friend and personal bodyguard Pachanga . Kleinfeld, who stole one million dollars in payoff money from his Italian mob-boss client, Anthony \"Tony T\" Taglialucci, is coerced into providing his yacht to help Tony T break out of the Rikers Island prison barge. Kleinfeld begs for Carlito's assistance in the prison break, and Carlito reluctantly agrees. Under cover of night, Carlito, Kleinfeld, and Tony T's son, Frankie, sail to a floating buoy outside of the prison barge where Tony T is waiting. As they pull Tony T aboard, Kleinfeld unexpectedly bludgeons him to death then slits Frankie's throat and dumps both of their bodies in the East River. Carlito immediately severs his ties with Kleinfeld and decides to leave town with Gail. The next day, Kleinfeld barely survives a retaliatory assassination attempt when he's stabbed in the chest at his office by two mobsters. Carlito is apprehended by police and taken to District Attorney Norwalk's  office where he is played a tape of Kleinfeld making a deal and offering to testify to false criminal allegations against Carlito. Norwalk advises that he is aware of Carlito as an accomplice to the Taglialucci murders in an attempt to leverage him into betraying Kleinfeld to save himself, but Carlito refuses. Carlito visits Kleinfeld under police protection in the hospital, where Kleinfeld confesses to selling him out; Carlito warns Kleinfeld that he's crossed the line from being a lawyer to acting like a gangster, and other gangsters will treat him accordingly. Carlito then buys train tickets to Miami for himself and Gail, now pregnant. When he stops by his club to get the stashed money, Carlito is met by a group of Italian mobsters led by Vinnie. The Italians plan on killing Carlito, but he manages to slip out through a secret exit. The Italians pursue him throughout the city's subway system and into Grand Central Terminal where they engage in a gunfight. Carlito kills all of his pursuers except Vinnie, who is shot and killed by police attracted by the gunfire. As Carlito runs to catch the train where Gail and Pachanga are waiting for him, he is ambushed by a disguised Benny, who shoots Carlito several times in the abdomen with a silenced gun. Pachanga admits to the dying Carlito that he is now working for Benny, only to be shot as well. Carlito hands a tearful Gail the money and tells her to escape with their unborn child and start a new life elsewhere. As he is wheeled away on a gurney, Carlito stares at a billboard with a Caribbean beach and a picture of a woman. The billboard then comes to life in his mind, and the woman, who is clearly Gail, starts dancing as Carlito slowly passes away.\n","\n","    ### Response:  Carlito's Way\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the details of the movie and the plot summary and idenitfy which movie is being described.\n","\n","    ### Context:\n","    Film Genre:['Crime Fiction', 'Bollywood'], Starring the actors: ['Juhi Chawla', 'Chiranjeevi', 'Rami Reddy', 'Kulbhushan Kharbanda', 'Ramesh Deo', 'J.V.

The only dwelling on the island, Fairweather Cottage, is seasonally operated by the owner Doug from the mainland and only reachable by ferry. After previously suffering a miscarriage, Kate's relationship with Martin has become tense, and in an effort to rekindle their marriage they decide on a return visit to the island. A few nights into their stay, the generator in the cottage explodes, injuring Martin's arm and leaving them without electricity. They use the CB radio, their only source of communication to the mainland, to call Doug who agrees to ferry out to help them. Kate spends the next day waiting at the jetty for Doug to arrive, but to no avail. Later a mysterious man in green combat fatigues washes up on the island, bloodied and half-conscious. When he comes round, he identifies himself as a soldier, Private Jack Coleman . He tells Martin and Kate that there has been an outbreak of an airborne disease, Argromoto Flu, codenamed R1N16, which started in South America and has spread over the entire world in the timespan of a few weeks. The virus is incurable and highly contagious, attacking the respiratory system and causing the victims to choke on blood with a 100% fatality rate. Jack says that the military has lost control, and is now advising civilians to seal themselves up in their homes and not allow anybody access. With only static now coming from the CB radio, Martin decides to play it safe and help Jack, who aggressively takes command, board up the door and the windows. Over the next few days, Jack becomes increasingly strange and erratic, and his intimidating behaviour begins to disturb the couple even further. They even suspect that the virus may not be real and Jack may be insane. When Kate asks him if he is married, he tells her his wife died of R1N16 and he becomes aggressive and threatening. Martin and Kate decide to leave the cottage and take their chances outside, but Jack refuses to let them, forcing them into the bedroom at gunpoint and locking them in. Martin sneaks outside through a skylight, finding the bodies of Doug and his wife at the pier, killed by gunshot wounds. Using Doug's hunting shotgun, Martin returns to the cottage and gets the upper hand on Jack. However, just as Kate begins to tie Jack's hands behind his back, Martin suddenly begins coughing up blood; it appears the Argromoto Flu is very real and he is infected. Kate is forced to shoot her husband dead with the shotgun, to spare him a slow and agonising death. Jack reveals to Kate that he was experimented upon at a secure military compound, from where he was released without realizing he was a carrier of R1N16. Jack infected his wife, killing her, and he fled to Blackholme Island to quarantine himself. Jack reveals the CB radio worked all along, and he just changed the settings so Kate and Martin would not be able to reach anyone. Jack fixes the CB radio and the military broadcast on it claims the soldiers have a vaccine to the virus. He tells her that the military are lying, there is no vaccine, and that the military will not allow them to leave the island alive. Kate does not believe him, and angered by the possibility that Martin could have been saved she shoots Jack dead. As she attempts to leave the island in the boat with Martin's body, a military helicopter flies over and she is killed by a sniper who shoots her in the head.\n","\n","    ### Response: 100 Feet\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the details of the movie and the plot summary and idenitfy which movie is being described.\n","\n","    ### Context:\n","    Film Genre:['Thriller', 'Drama', 'Horror', 'Psychological thriller', 'Teen'], Starring the actors: ['Haley Bennett', 'Jake Weber', 'Chace Crawford', 'Shannon Marie Woodward', 'Shanna Collins', 'AnnaLynne McCord', 'Marin Hinkle', 'Nina Siemaszko', 'Josh Stewart', 'Jessica Lowndes', 'Randy Wayne', 'Jamie McShane', 'Kevin Cooney', 'Ron Canada', 'Ross Thomas'], Released in the year: 2008, Summary of the movie plot: The film begins with a teenage girl  going into the woods to meet her boyfriend.

Molly lives with her father Robert  and her mother is locked up in a mental ward outside the town she recently moved to. Her father enrolls Molly in a new school to help with the trauma and start a new life. However, as her 18th birthday approaches, Molly must deal with both the stress of being a new student and with the continuing nightmares she has of her mother's attack. Joseph , a student at her new school, attempts to help her. However, Molly begins to display symptoms of the same psychosis that took control of her mother's life. One night, her mother escapes and tries to kidnap her, but Molly escapes. The next morning she is cornered by Jane and discovers that she, and others who share her mother's concerns, want to kill her in order to save her from a preordained life as a servant to Satan.

We meet haggard Vice Principal Rubell  and clueless Principal Horn, as well as stuffy lawyer and former JFK alumna Lisa Hammond , who is in charge of taking depositions for the Calvin case, in which a recent graduate is suing the school for giving him a diploma despite his illiteracy. Alex Jurel  is a veteran Social Studies teacher who takes his job lightly despite being one of the most popular teachers in school because of his ability to identify and connect with the students. Jurel has been worn down by years of being in-between the rowdy students and the demands of the administration . He is assigned to temporarily take over the duties of the school psychologist  and meets a young man named Eddie Pilikian  to whom he becomes a mentor. The major plotline centers on the Calvin lawsuit, with Superintendent Donna Burke  and school lawyer Al Lewis  attempting to avoid bad publicity associated with the case. To this end, they try to figure out which teachers will \"rock the boat,\" or are critical of the school board policies. Intertwined with the major storyline are Jurel's efforts to reform Pilikian into a student who believes in himself and Jurel's growing moral conundrum that ultimately culminates in a showdown with Dr. Burke, who threatens to fire Jurel if he does not resign. A number of minor plotlines deviate from the primary goings-on. These include Herbert Gower/Stuart Van Ark , an outpatient from a mental institution who is accidentally put in charge of a U.S. History class and makes it fun and engaging; gym teacher Mr. Troy‚Äôs sexual relationship with a student that ends with Jurel taking the girl to an abortion clinic ; and the death of Eddie Pilikian‚Äôs friend Danny , a schizophrenic and kleptomaniac student who is shot and killed by the police after he draws a gun from his locker during a drug search. A romance also begins between Jurel and the attorney Lisa Hammond who at one point strips herself naked in the middle of a hallway. This incident causes Pilikian to pull the fire alarm. While the school is outside, Jurel stands up to Dr. Burke and Vice Principal Rubell saying that he won't resign, and he'll sue them if he gets fired. Jurel then makes a speech about how the whole reason for building the school was for the kids, and how the teachers are supposed to be there for them, which causes the other students to give him an ovation while going back into the building. By the end of the film, Lisa manages to convince Jurel that despite their many flaws, the students of JFKHS are worth risking reputation and career.\n","\n","    ### Response: 6teen\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the details of the movie and the plot summary and idenitfy which movie is being described.\n","\n","    ### Context:\n","    Film Genre:['Melodrama', 'Japanese Movies', 'World cinema', 'Period piece', 'Drama', 'Biopic [feature]', 'Romantic drama', 'Biographical film', 'Romance Film'], Starring the actors: ['Mads Mikkelsen', 'Anna Mouglalis', 'Elena Morozova', 'Natacha Lindinger', 'Grigori Manukov', 'Radivoje Bukvic', 'Nicolas Vaude', 'Anatole Taubman', 'Erick Desmarestz', 'Clara Guelblum'], Released in the year: 2009, Summary of the movie plot: An introductory scene takes place in Paris in 1913, where Coco Chanel attends the first, scandalous performance of Igor Stravinsky‚Äôs The Rite of Spring. The rhythmic dissonance of the score and the surprising choreography of the piece result in heckling and outrage among much of the audience. But Chanel is impressed by Stravinsky and his music. Seven years later, Chanel and Stravinsky meet again. Although her business has flourished, Chanel is mourning the death of her lover, Arthur \"Boy\" Capel. Stravinsky has chosen to flee to France following the Russian Revolution. An immediate sympathy and attraction occurs between the ‚Äòcouturiere‚Äô and the composer. Chanel invites Stravinsky to live in her villa outside Paris, along with his ailing wife and their children. The summer months that follow see Chanel and Stravinsky begin an affair, one which Stravinsky's wife can not avoid becoming aware of. Tensions between Stravinsky and his wife, and between Stravinsky's wife and Chanel, are unavoidable. The film implies that the affair, and the later termination of the affair by Chanel, has a major influence on the lives of both Chanel and Stravinsky. It is during this time that Chanel creates Chanel No. 5 with her perfumer, Ernest Beaux, and that Stravinsky begins to compose in a new, more liberated style. It is especially implied that the termination of the affair inspired some of the most moving passages in Stravinsky's new composition.\n","\n","    ### Response: 17 August 1913\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the details of the movie and the plot summary and idenitfy which movie is being described.\n","\n","    ### Context:\n","    Film Genre:['Drama', 'Filipino Movies', 'World cinema'], Starring the actors: ['Alessandra de Rossi', 'Gina Alajar', 'Pierro Rodriguez', 'Dexter Doria', 'Bryan Homecillo'], Released in the year: 2002, Summary of the movie plot: Melinda  is a new substitute teacher at the Malawig Elementary School, located in a poor remote barrio.

Four children: Andreu Ramallo, Manuel Tur, Pau Inglada and a girl Francisca are witness to the execution of leftists at the hands of pro-Franco villagers. In a desperate act of revenge, Pau, whose father has been killed the previous day by the lead executioner, plans to avenge his father's murder torturing Juli√† Ballester, the son of his father's killer. His idea is to force the boy to drink castor oil. However, things go wrong when the boy‚ÄîJuli√† Ballester‚Äîtaunts them and Pau becomes enraged. He brutally kills Juli√† by bashing his head against a rock and then stabbing him in the throat. Unable to deal with what he has just done, Pau commits suicide jumping inside a hole on a cave. The remaining children: Andreu, Manuel, and Francisa are witnesses to these tragic events. Over a decade later, Ramallo, now a cocky young man, is sent to a tuberculosis sanatorium on Mallorca to recuperate from the initial stages of the disease. Ramallo, like all the tubercular and lung diseased patients, has to live in a large room, dormitory style. However, as a patient's health dwindles and they are expected to die, they are sent to a private room numbered 13 for their final days. Ramallo with his boastfulness and stories of sexual prowess attracts the admiration of the other patients particularly from Galindo, the youngest of the group. Ramallo is shocked to find that Manuel Tur, his childhood friend, is also a patient. A pale and drawn man, Manuel has found solace to his health predicament in religion. Even more shocking is the sight of the beautiful Francisca, now a selfless nun, nursing the sick at the hospital. Alcantara, the brutal caretaker and Carmen, his unhappy wife, run the place. Shortly after his arrival, Ramallo receives the unwanted visit of Don Eugeni Morel his former boss in smuggling contraband. The well to do middle age Morel, has also sexually abused him for long time. Morel's visit makes Ramallo furious and from then on, he tries to disassociate himself from the crime lord. As a reminder than he can count only on himself, Ramallo gets his own name tattooed on his chest by Alcantara, the hospital's maintenance guy. In the clinic, Manuel has a pet cat that he dotes on. In a fit of anger Ramallo kicks the cat almost to death. Manuel gives the dying animal back to Ramallo to put it out of its misery. They bury the animal together and reconcile remembering their childhood friendship. Ramallo wants to get rid of Morel for good, but his first attempt to steal some money from the church of the sanatorium fails when he is discovered by Francisca. As a child, she had a crush on him and now she is glad to see him again, but assures him that she is perfectly happy in her life as a nun. Ramallo starts scheming to hijack smuggling good from Morel. He recruits Manuel in helping him to steal the keys of Alcantara's car in order to go to the nearby port. In the middle of this dealing, Galindo's death affects Ramallo deeply. Carmen has a soft spot for Manuel and seduces him. At first Manuel tries to resist the temptation because she is a married woman, but she assures him that she is unhappy in her marriage and only feels disgust for her husband. They have sex, but when Manuel finds out that she came to visit him on Ramallo's suggestion, he tells her to leave him alone. Manuel angrily confronts Ramallo accusing him of being jealous of his purity. Ramallo leaves him silent telling him that his anger comes because he is secretly in love with him. In fact attracted to his friend, Manuel steals Ramallo's clothes but, in his morbid religious fervor, fights his desires that he believes are diabolical.

The two men, Goro and Yoshi, had brawled earlier that day, and no sooner had they entered the mine then the shaft had quickly flooded. Shigeru Kawamura , head of security at the mine, heads below to investigate. There, he and the local police make a gruesome discovery: Yoshi's lacerated corpse. Above ground, a doctor examines Yoshi, and discovers the cause of death to be a series of deep gashes caused by an abnormally sharp object. As some of the miners comfort Yoshi's wailing wife, the others discuss the possibility of Goro's involvement in the death. The two had never been friends, and had physically fought that morning. Also, Goro was still missing, and could be on the run or still be hiding in the mine. Shigeru warns them not to speak of this until the police investigation begins. Outside, Shigeru meets with his fiance Kiyo , who is also Goro's sister. He comforts her, telling her that he is sure of Goro's innocence. Inside the mine, three policemen stand guard at the edge of the water, knowing if Goro tries to escape, he will surely come that way . Suddenly, they hear a splash in the flooded mine, and venture into the water. As they wade deeper into the shaft, they get more and more nervous. All of a sudden, one of the policemen begins to scream and then disappears under the water. As the men are tied together, is is not to long before another is pulled under by something beneath the surface. The last policeman quickly unties himself and flees. However, before he can escape, he is cornered and attacked by someone, or something. Soon after, his body, along with the bodies of the other two policemen, are brought up and examined. The doctor announces that they, too, were killed by a sharp object that simply sliced them apart. Later that night, the wife of one of the murdered men runs to Kiyo's house and screams threats at her through the door, as she believes that her brother, Goro, is the killer. Shigeru soon arrives and comforts her, telling her that the officers that were killed were Goro's friends, and that he had no reason to kill them. Someone else, then, killed those men. As the two sit together, the answer to the question of who, or what, murdered the men suddenly reveals itself: a gigantic creature, resembling a gigantic insect larva, enters Kiyo's home, and both Kiyo and Shigeru flee. The police enter the home, but the giant insect forces them to flee. When they regroup, they chase the creature to the top of a hill and open fire with machine guns. The monster launches its self down the hillside and grabs two officers, clutching them in its pincers as it flees. It soon drops them and quickly escapes back into the mine. When the police and Shigeru reach the injured officers, they discover that their wounds match the wounds of the murdered policemen and Yoshi. They have found the killer. Soon after, Shigeru and a group of the metro-police head back into the mine to confront the insect monster and attempt to locate Goro, dead or alive. Unfortunately, as they enter the deepest part of the mine shaft, they discover the butchered body of Goro laying on the floor of the mine. As they approach, the giant insect emerges and chases the men back up the mine shaft. Taking action, Shigeru releases the mine cart, which rolls down the shaft and collides with the insect, crushing and killing it. Shigeru and the others then venture back into the shaft and remove Goro's body. They discover a large hole in the wall that opens up into a large cave. They realize that this is the hole through which the water and the giant insect emerged. As they peek through, they are noticed by not just one, but several more giant insects. However, before the monsters can attack, the ground begins to shake, and the mine begins to cave in. Shigeru is trapped in the cave, and the police can do nothing and the mine collapses. The next day, the police investigate the recent happenings. Dr. Kashiwagi identifies the giant insect as a Meganulon, an ancient species of dragonfly larvae that had lived on the Earth millions of years earlier. As the doctor reveals his findings, an earthquake suddenly strikes the area. Rumors begin to circulate that Mt. Aso, the volcano that eclipses Kitamatsu, might be on the verge of an eruption. When the police arrive at the base of the volcano to investigate the damage caused by the earthquake, they are shocked to discover a man wandering around the epicenter. When they reach him, they discover that it is Shigeru. However, he has received a blow to the head and has lost his memory. He is even unable to recognize Kiyo. The doctors are not optimistic about his chances for recovery, but nevertheless do their best to try to help him any way that they can. Several miles away, in Kyushu, an air base receives an alert from one of their jets. The pilot has observed an unidentified flying object performing impossible maneuvers at supersonic speeds. He is ordered to pursue the object at distance, but as he follows it, the object suddenly changes course and turns around. The object then flies straight towards the jet and destroys it. Soon after, reports from all over the world come in about the UFO. The strange object is observed flying over China, Philippines and Japan, and rumors of a secret military weapon test begin to circulate. Back in Japan, a newly married couple disappear, as well as several heads of cattle around Mt. Aso. When the authorities develop the film from the newlyweds' camera, they discover a photograph of what appears to be a gigantic wing. They match the photo with a drawing of a Pteranodon, an ancient reptile thought to be extinct millions of years earlier. Although the evidence seems to point to the Pteranodon as the culprit, the theory is dismissed as being too far fetched. Meanwhile, Shigeru's treatment is progressing slowly, but no one, especially not Kiyo, is giving up. One day, as Shigeru sits silently in his hospital room, Kiyo shows him the eggs that her pet birds have lain. As one of the eggs hatches, a terrible memory returns to Shigeru: Deep within the mine, Shigeru awoke after the cave in. Suddenly, he realized to his horror that he was surrounded by hundreds of Meganulon. The creatures crawled all around the cave, having survived millions of years underground. Shigeru then looked up and was shocked to see what appeared to be a giant egg sitting right in the middle of the cave. Suddenly, the egg began to stir, and then, all of a sudden, it hatched. From out of the fractured shell emerged a gigantic, winged creature with a sharp beak and a head like a bird of prey. Shigeru watched in horror as the enormous hatchling bent over and began to eat the Meganulon. The monstrous insects that had terrorized the town and had killed his friends were now nothing more than a snack to this new creature. With all of the Meganulon gone, the giant monster spread its wings and roared... Shigeru suddenly awakens, his memory restored. As he recovers from seeing the horrifying vision, Kiyo weeps with joy. Shigeru confirms that the creature he saw did indeed resemble a pteranodon, and that it had eaten all of the Meganulon. He and a group of police and scientists once again descend into the mine and enter the cave where the egg had been. They are able to recover a fragment of the shell before a rock slide forces them to flee back to the surface. In the lab, Dr. Kashiwagi is able to determine the size of the egg and its age: 200 million years old. After amassing the evidence, Kashiwagi calls a meeting with members of the town, along with members of the Japanese Self-Defence Force to communicate his findings. He tells the men that the UFO seen flying all across the world at supersonic speeds is a gigantic pteranodon he has dubbed Rodan. The 50 meter tall monster is capable of flying at extremely fast speeds, which create a sonic boom that more than likely led to the destruction of the jet that had first observed Rodan. Kashiwagi still has no explanation as to how the creature could have transversed the globe so quickly, and why reports of sightings occurred in multiple, distant countries at the same time. As to how Rodan could have resurfaced after millions of years is also a mystery, but Kashiwagi theorizes that nuclear bomb testing, which loosened the Earth and opened cavities to long buried crevices and caves, might be the culprit. However, Kashiwagi admits that this is only a guess. Soon after, Rodan emerges from the ground near Mt. Aso, near where the beast had hatched. The creature takes flight and begins to head for Kyushu, with a squadron of the JASDF hot on his tail. They pursue Rodan over the city, and eventually succeed in forcing him into the river. The flying reptile soon emerges, but his flight speed has been cut by half. Rodan flies over the buildings at Fukuoka, and the sonic wave created in its wake literally tears the structures apart. The flying monster lands in the city and flaps its wings, and the entire city is literally pulled down by its own weight. Fires spread, and the JSDF attempt in vain to fight the creature off. The men, and the machines, are simply blown away. Just when it seems things can't get worse, the JSDF reports that another Rodan has been spotted heading towards the city. With the mystery of the spread out sightings now revealed, the second Rodan now flies over and rips apart the buildings. After leveling the city and leaving the remaining buildings in flames, the monsters Rodan fly away, leaving thousands dead. The JSDF formulate a plan to attack the Rodans. After ascertaining their location at their old nest at the base of Mt. Aso, the military plan to shell the volcano and trigger an eruption that will trap the monsters under the lava and rock. However, Kitamatsu will be completely destroyed in the attack, and the town is forced to evacuate. The army prepares for the attack. Just moments before the strike is to begin, Shigeru looks out the window to see Kiyo climbing up the hill. He runs out to meet her, and she tells him that she has come to be with him. Rather than evacuate, she has risked her life to face the danger with the man she loves. The two leave the area and return to safety, and the military begins its attack. They launch rockets and torpedoes at the mountain, and soon the volcano begins to spew smoke and lava into the sky. One of the Rodans emerges, but is soon overcome by the fumes. As the second Rodan arrives on the scene, the first loses altitude and finally falls into the stream of lava flowing down the side of the volcano. The ancient reptile begins to scream in pain as it burns alive in the lava. The military, Dr. Kashiwagi, Shigeru and Kiyo watch from a safe distance as the still flying Rodan watches its companion die in agony. Suddenly, the second Rodan descends and lands with the first in the lava, and it too begins to burn. Rather then live on alone, the creature will die with its companion. Whether they be siblings or mates, the two Rodans lie dying together in the flowing lava. Kiyo buries her head in Shigeru's shoulder and weeps, and both Kashiwagi and Shigeru watch solemnly as the two monsters, each unwilling to live without the other, die together on the slopes of the erupting volcano.\n","\n","    ### Response:  Rodan\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the details of the movie and the plot summary and idenitfy which movie is being described.\n","\n","    ### Context:\n","    Film Genre:['Alien invasion', 'Science Fiction', 'Black-and-white', 'Cult', 'Alien Film', 'Monster'], Starring the actors: ['Jeff Morrow', 'Barbara Lawrence', \"George O'Hanlon\", 'John Emery', 'Morris Ankrum', 'Robert Shayne'], Released in the year: 1957, Summary of the movie plot: What appears to be a large saucer shaped meteorite crashes into the Pacific Ocean near Mexico, following an unexplained break-in and assault by a deranged man at a secret U.S. research facility.

He returns to Hong Kong after being in Singapore for a number of years to try to forget his anguish. To cover up his pain, he becomes a suave ladies' man. Chow attends many lavish parties and beds many women. On Christmas Eve, Chow meets Lulu from the first film  whom he remembers from Singapore, although she has no recollection of him. That night, Chow Mo-wan takes Lulu home as she is quite drunk, but accidentally keeps her room key. As he leaves, he notices that her room number is 2046, the same room number that he and Su Li Zhen had when they conducted their private affair. Upon returning a few days later to return the room key, the landlord informs Chow that the room is not available due to renovations. The landlord offers him the adjacent room 2047. Chow later learns that Lulu was stabbed in the room the night before by a jealous boyfriend. Chow agrees to rent room 2047 in the meantime. After the renovation of room 2046 is complete, the landlord asks Chow if he wants to move in. However, by this time he has gotten used to room 2047 and decides to stay there. The rooms 2046 and 2047 are connected by a common hallway, Chow regularly watches and gets involved with the people that move into 2046. Wang Jing Wen and Wang Jie Wen arc part I The first person that moves next door into 2046 is the landlord's daughter, Wang Jing Wen . Chow spends a good deal of time just observing her from his room. He learns that she has a Japanese boyfriend working in Hong Kong. Unfortunately, the relationship is forbidden by her father. Eventually, Wang breaks up with her boyfriend, then suffers a breakdown and is institutionalised. Afterwards, the next tenant that moves into 2046 is the younger daughter of the landlord, Wang Jie Wen. She is young, attractive, and flirtatious. She frequently tries to seduce him but he refuses each time. A short time later, Chow runs into some financial difficulties, and stops going out. To make some extra money, he starts to write a science fiction series called 2046. The story is set in the distant future, about a group of heart sick individuals looking for love. The only place to find it is at a mysterious location called 2046. Virtually all of the characters in 2046 are based on people that Chow has met, such as Su Li-Zhen, Lulu, or Wang Jing Wen. Whether 2046 is a place, a room, or a state of mind is never explicitly defined. Chow makes the story somewhat bizarre and erotic, and readers seem to take notice. Bai Ling arc part I The third person to move into room 2046 is the coquettish Bai Ling . She wears similar qipao dresses as the original Su Li-Zhen but radiates a much more aggressive sensuality than her. While it is never explicitly stated in the film, it is implied that she is a nightclub girl who occasionally doubles as a high-class prostitute. However, she is intent on finding a long-term relationship. In one instance, when Chow overhears her arguing with a man, Bai tells the man that to continue seeing her, he must end his relationship with the other woman. Chow again spends a lot of time observing her across the thin wall separating rooms 2046 and 2047. On the next Christmas Eve, Bai runs into Chow just after she is dumped by her boyfriend before they are to go to Singapore. Chow suggests that they go for dinner, to which she grudgingly accepts. During dinner, Chow tells Bai about his experiences in Singapore. She is intrigued, and after dinner she agrees to try to form a platonic friendship with him by borrowing time from each other. Their brief friendship does not last however, as they soon develop carnal lust for each other. Not surprisingly, Chow wants to keep the relationship strictly physical; he continues to pick up other prostitutes. To compromise, Bai soon develops a compensation system where he pays her 10 Hong Kong dollars  each time he stays over. However, over time Bai finds that she has feelings for Chow, and she asks him to discontinue seeing other women. Chow refuses and gives a counter offer, the option to be his customer for $10 each night. Bai is crushed and breaks things off with Chow. As a way of revenge, Bai then descends into seeing men exclusively for money, frequently changing partners. A short while later, she moves out of Room 2046. Wang Jing Wen part II After Bai Ling moves out, Wang Jin Wen moves back into 2046 after returning from the mental hospital. She is a shell of a former self, and still very depressed over the loss of her Japanese boyfriend. Her ex writes numerous letters in an attempt to reconcile with her, but she refuses due to her father. Wang passes the time by assisting her father at the hotel. She also starts to spend more and more time with Chow helping him with his writing and editing. At this point, he is regularly publishing chapters of 2046. These scenes are very similar to those in In the Mood for Love when Su Li-Zhen used to help Chow with his writing in their hotel room. Chow remarks that this period in his life is the happiest that he has been after Su Li-Zhen. However, before he realises it, he develops feelings for Wang Jing Wen. He makes some minor attempts to start a romance with her, but nothing develops since she is still very much in love with the Japanese man. One day Wang Jin Wen asks Chow rhetorically if some things in life never change. He answers her by writing a story called 2047. In this story, a Japanese man leaves the world of 2046, but falls in love on the journey home. While he initially tried to base the story on Wang Jing Wen's ex-boyfriend, he realises that the story is ultimately about himself. 2047 arc part II Chow's fictional world is revisited. However, this time it is narrated by Chow himself. Set in the far future, for passengers to reach or leave 2046 they must take a long journey on a vast train network. The main character, Tak  is trying to leave 2046 because he lost the love of his life in that world. As the train travels through the extremely cold sections 1224‚Äì1225, Tak becomes intimate with one of the train's female android assistants  and later falls in love with her. He then asks her numerous times to come with him. However, each time the android does not answer. Tak has heard earlier that excessive operation causes the android's response time to slow down and decides to wait on the train to see if this is the case. He sits quietly on the train, and counts the seconds that go by, hoping the android will decide to leave with him. However, the android still does not respond. Ultimately, Tak realises that it is not a delayed reaction that causes that android not to respond, but that she is in love with someone else and that their relationship is simply not meant to be. With this knowledge, he finally has the strength to leave the train and 2046. Completing the story marks a turning point in Chow's recovery. Wang Jing Wen part III Next Christmas, Chow invites Wang Jing Wen out to dinner. After finding out that she still misses her ex in Japan, he takes her to his office so that she can call him to wish him well. Looking sadly through the window panes as Wang Jing Wen is overjoyed talking to her ex, Chow remarks that in fact Section 1224-1225 from the story are simply the dates for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day when everyone is especially lonely and needs additional love. He goes on to say that while he had feelings for her, and most likely could have taken advantage of the situation  he was happy that in this situation he did the \"right thing\". The call re-ignites the romance. Soon afterward, Wang Jing Wen moves to Japan and gets engaged. A short while later, while still feeling depressed over the loss of Wang Jing Wen, Chow runs into Lulu again as she has a violent confrontation with another woman that is sleeping with her current playboy boyfriend. This incident is identical to one that occurred in the original Days of Being Wild when she confronted the original Su Li-Zhen for sleeping with Yuddy. Chow remarks that Lulu, is likely to forever remain living in the past. However, he then remarks that this is not really a sad thing, as she seems perfectly content to be miserable. The incident strengthens Chow's resolve to get over Su Li-Zhen. Bai Ling arc part II Some time later, Chow gets a call from Bai Ling and the two go out to dinner. This time, Bai looks much less glamorous and more \"run-down\". She informs Chow that she plans to leave for Singapore, and asks him to provide a reference and plane fare. She also asks where he was last Christmas, as she stopped by at that time, and was hoping to see him. In fact, she remarks that she really misses him. It turns out, during last Christmas, Chow had gone back to Singapore in an attempt to find a former lover, another woman named Su Li-Zhen . Su Li-Zhen Arc Chronologically, this arc occurs first in the film. Chow met the second Su Li-Zhen some years back when he first arrived in Singapore. At that time, he was still grieving over losing the original Su Li-Zhen and spending much of his free time in the local casinos. After losing much of his savings, he encounters the second Su Li-Zhen, a mysterious gambler. They become lovers, and he soon wants to know everything about her. But she insists that he beat her in a \"high-card\" draw before she will reveal anything about her past, which he never is able to do. Eventually, she agrees to help him win back his money so that he can return to Hong Kong. When she does so, he prepares to leave, and asks her to go with him. Again, she challenges him to a high-card draw, which he again loses. Knowing little about her, Chow speculates that she, like himself, has a troubled past. Initially heartbroken about this, he remarks that after he completes the story '2047' he finally understands why the second Su Li-Zhen did not go with him, as he would again have tried to recapture the past by looking for elements of the original Su Li-Zhen. When Chow went back to Singapore to visit her the second time, he does not find her. He makes some inquiries as to her whereabouts and speculates that she either returned to Cambodia or was killed. Bai Ling arc part III Shortly after the events of 'Bai Ling arc part II' and the night before she boards a plane for Singapore, Chow again meets Bai Ling for dinner. Bai remarks that, between their two meetings, one of her clients has given her a lot of money and she wants to pay Chow back immediately. He refuses to take the money. Bai insists on paying for dinner, and Chow is stunned when she hands him a stack of money, each $10 bill representing one night they had spent together. Bai tells Chow to pay for dinner with this stack of bills, while unbeknownst to him, she sadly watches behind the restaurant's green window veils. After dinner, Chow walks her back to her apartment. Grasping his hands at the apartment door, she begs him to lend his time to her once more and spend the night. She then asks him \"Why can't it be like it was before?\" He refuses to stay over, even out of pity, coldly stating that that is simply something he would never lend. He exits by jerking his hands away from her and remarks in voiceover that this was the last time he ever saw her. He leaves in a taxi, staring emptily into space, as the camera slowly enters a whispering hole.\n","\n","    ### Response: 2046\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the details of the movie and the plot summary and idenitfy which movie is being described.\n","\n","    ### Context:\n","    Film Genre:['Drama', 'Black-and-white'], Starring the actors: ['Martin Balsam', 'Serge Reggiani', 'Eduardo De Filippo', 'Nino Castelnuovo', 'Alberto Sordi', 'Carla Gravina', 'Claudio Gora'], Released in the year: , Summary of the movie plot: Along the Venetian seaside, on the morning of September 8, 1943, Alberto Innocenzi , junior NCO of the Royal Italian Army is shocked when (in response to the separate surrender signed by the Badoglio government in [[Cassibile  the former allies of the Wehrmacht surround and take by storm the base where he's stationed. After a comical exchange with a superior command he gets in touch with by telephone  he, along with some disbanded soldiers, manages to distance the German troops and is thoroughly shocked when, contrary to his plan of finding a higher echelon to which to report, most of the men accept the fact that the war is over for them and \"everybody should just go home\". This reaction at first angers him, but in the end he joins army engineer Ceccarelli  and sergeant Fornaciari  in discarding their uniforms for civilian clothes and heading southwards for a veritable odyssey along the Italian \"boot\", cut in two by German and Allied occupation and wracked by partisan warfare, bloody reprisals, German press-ganging and other perils. The trio meets a band of anti-fascist guerrillas but decline to join them . Later Innocenzi, caught in the \"everybody for himself\" mentality which seems to dominate the landscape, succumbs to the temptation of abandoning his mates to help a sultry black marketeer smuggle a load of flour to Rome, as she needs a driver and does not have room for any other passengers. The deal goes awry due to a mechanical failure in a rubble-strewn town where the famished populace plunders the lorry, and after some recriminations and a brief scuffle, Innocenzi rejoins his companions. They witness the killing of a rookie, a naive Italian soldier who tried to protect a Jewish girl during a German roundup; finally they manage to reach Fornaciari's rural home. The former sergeant is delighted of having returned to his young wife, children and old father and offers Innocenzi and Ceccarelli hospitality for the night; his wife reveals that the family has been hiding a former U.S. POW  who escaped from the Folpiano prison camp to protect him from the fascist militia patrols and Fornaciari, albeit grudgingly, accepts to keep protecting him. After a darkly humorous polenta dinner  they all go to sleep but a nighttime fascist patrol breaks in and manages to find the Allied serviceman. Amidst the children's cries and his wife's weeping, Fornaciari is hauled away toward a grim fate, and Ceccarelli and Innocenzi flee the premises without being able to help. The couple manages to reach Littoria , where Innocenzi's widowed father, , lives alone and offers Ceccarelli  to stay a few days before resuming his travel south. Innocenzi is shocked when his father introduces him to a fascist party leader who is recruiting men for the army of the Repubblica Sociale Italiana, the fascist puppet state instituted by the Germans after the liberation of Benito Mussolini from his Gran Sasso exile. His father angrily responds to his objections, citing the misery he's living in and all the sacrifices he incurred to allow make him to study and become an army officer; a deep rift is created between father and son, and Innocenzi asks Ceccarelli to take him south to Naples as well, to which the engineer happily consents. However Naples is in grimmer conditions than Rome, directly on the line of fire after the Allied landing at Salerno, barely kept under control by brutal German detachments who round up able-bodied men to send them to Germany as slave workers. To reach the city the duo passes through a roadblock manned by fanatical, hungry fascists; Ceccarelli, generously chooses to sacrifice a suitcase of delicacies he was meant to deliver to the wife of his Commanding Officer . The situation  causes Innocenzi much panic, having had raided the case during a night-time train trip and substituting the goods with stones and newspaper sheets; he urges his companion to run away before the fascists open it, but they are unsuccessful. Innocenzi and Ceccarelli are pressed in an Organisation Todt rubble-clearing chain gang and manage to escape when the city insurges against the occupiers in the Four days of Naples. Desperately trying to reach his home, which is just a few blocks away, Ceccarelli is cut down in a hail of German fire, at which time Innocenzi decides that the real war to be waged is that against the Nazi occupiers and joins an insurgent band offering to man the Breda M 37 machine gun they have captured but cannot operate. With a renewed stern look on his face, Innocenzi opens fire against the Germans, bringing the movie to a close.\n","\n","    ### Response: 8 September\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the details of the movie and the plot summary and idenitfy which movie is being described.\n","\n","    ### Context:\n","    Film Genre:['Propaganda film'], Starring the actors: ['Attila H√∂rbiger'], Released in the year: 1941, Summary of the movie plot: In the Wo≈Çy≈Ñ Voivodeship in eastern Poland, the German minority is oppressed by the Polish majority.

The owner decides to get Benjamin, the black manager of the club, to talk to Elsie and try to persuade her to cooperate. Benjamin refuses and quits his job. Benjamin tells Elsie of his conversation with the owner and persuades Elsie to stay on because she is popular and can make a lot of money, but he warns her to be careful. Elsie stays, but still refuses to date the customers. Later, the owner hires John and Clyde, Elsie's uncles, to replace Benjamin. One evening, after the club closes, Elsie goes home and finds at her horror that her aunt, who lives with her, is dead. She calls the police and they discover that her aunt has been murdered by a single blow in the head. The police question Elsie and do not believe her story, so they arrest her for the death of her aunt. John and Clyde testify that they saw Elsie on the night of the murder leaving the club for a short time and later returning. Mrs. Green, the sister of Clyde and John, tells the police that Elsie bought a large life insurance policy on her aunt, with herself as the beneficiary. With this evidence, Elsie is convicted of the crime and sent to prison. Benjamin, who has now become a detective on the police force, and Detective Wanzer, who is a close friend of Elsie's, do not believe that she is guilty and set out to find the real killer. After some investigation, they learn that Mrs. Green's husband was actually in love with Elsie's aunt. With jealousy as a possible motive, Benjamin and Wanzer now suspect that Mrs. Green and her two sons are connected with the crime. One night they confront John and accuse him of the murder. John refuses to confess, so Benjamin and Wanzer take him to Tolston's Castle, which is supposed to be haunted. There they threaten to tie him up and leave him at the mercy of the ghosts. Terrified, John decides to tell all. He reveals the story of his sister's family, and tells them how her husband was tricked into marrying her. He told them that Mrs. Green's husband was in love with Elsie's aunt when they lived in the South. The husband, after realizing the trick, ran north, but Mrs. Green pursued him, and her two brothers threatened him to get back together with her. Although he stayed at home after that, Mrs. Green's husband continued to see Elsie's aunt and threatened to leave Mrs. Green. John continues, and admits that he and Clyde lied about seeing Elsie leave the club on the night of the murder. Furthermore, he tells that early in the evening on the night of the murder Mrs. Green found a note left by her husband. The note stated that, out of despair, he had decided to kill Elsie's aunt and then take his own life by jumping off a bridge into the river. John also relates that it was Mrs. Green's plan to frame Elsie for the crime. The police recover Mrs. Green's husband's body from the river, verifying John's story. On this new evidence, Elsie is granted a pardon by the Governor and released from prison. Out of deep gratitude and love, Elsie marries Benjamin, who has been in love with her all the time.Sampson, Henry T.

The conquest largely removed the native  ruling class, replacing it with a foreign, French-speaking monarchy, aristocracy, and clerical hierarchy. The story line monitors the transformation of Thomas Becket, portrayed, following the play, as a Saxon prot√©g√© and facilitator to the carousing King Henry, into a man who continually invokes the \"honor of God\". Henry appoints Becket as Archbishop of Canterbury in order to have a close confidant in this position that he could completely control. Instead, Becket becomes a major thorn in his side in a jurisdictional dispute. Much of the plot concerns Henry, the \"perennial adolescent\" as described by the Bishop of London, who finds his duties as king and his stale arranged marriage to be oppressive. Early in the film, we see him escaping them through drunken forays onto the hunting grounds and local brothels. He is increasingly dependent on Becket, a Saxon commoner, who arranges these debaucheries when he is not busy running Henry's court. This foments great resentment on the part of Henry's Norman noblemen, who distrust and envy this Saxon upstart, as well as the queen and queen mother, who see Becket as an unnatural and unseemly influence upon the royal personage. Henry finds himself in continuous conflict with the elderly Archbishop of Canterbury, who opposes the taxation of Church property in order to support Henry's military campaigns in France . During one of his campaigns in coastal France, he receives word that the old bishop has \"gone to God's bosom\". In a burst of inspiration, Henry exercises his prerogative to pick the next Archbishop and informs an astonished Becket that he is the royal choice. Shortly thereafter, Becket sides with the Church, throwing Henry into a fury. One of the main bones of contention is Thomas' excommunication of Lord Gilbert, one of Henry's most loyal stalwarts, for seizing and ordering the killing of a priest who had been accused of sexual indiscretions with a young girl, before the priest can even be handed over for ecclesiastical trial. Gilbert then refuses to acknowledge his transgressions and seek absolution. The King has a dramatic secret meeting with the Bishop of London in his cathedral . He lays out his plan to remove the troublesome cleric through scandal and innuendo which the position-conscious Bishop of London quickly agrees to . These attempts fall flat when Becket, in full ecclesiastic garb, confronts his accusers outside the rectory and routs them causing Henry to laugh and bitterly note the irony of it all, \"Becket is the only intelligent man in my entire kingdom...and he is against me!\" Becket escapes to France where he encounters the conniving yet sympathetic King Louis . King Louis sees in Becket a means by which he can further his favorite pastime, tormenting the arrogant English. Becket gets to Rome, where he begs the Holy Pontiff to allow him to renounce his position and retire to a monastery as an ordinary priest. The Vatican is a hotbed of intrigue and political jockeying. The Pope reminds Becket that he has an obligation as a matter of principle to return to England and take a stand against civil interference in Church matters. Becket yields to this decision and asks Louis to arrange a meeting with Henry on the beaches at Normandy. Henry asks Becket whether or not he loved him and Becket replied that he loved Henry to the best of his ability. A shaky truce is declared and Becket is allowed to return to England. The remainder of the film shows Henry rapidly sinking into drunken fixation over Becket and his perceived betrayal. The barons worsen his mood by pointing out that Becket has become a folk hero among the vanquished Saxons who are ever restive and resentful of their Norman conquerors. There are comical fights between Henry and his frumpy consort, Eleanor of Aquitaine, his dimwitted son/heir apparent, and his cold-blooded mother, who repeatedly reminds her son that his father would have quickly had someone like Becket done away with for the sake of the realm. During one of his drunken rages he asks \"Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest?\" His faithful barons hear this and proceed quickly to Canterbury, where they put Thomas and his Saxon deputy, Brother John, to the sword. A badly shaken Henry then undergoes a penance by whipping at the hands of Saxon monks. The film concludes with Henry, fresh from his whipping, publicly proclaiming Thomas Becket a saint and that the ones who had killed him will be justly punished.\n","\n","    ### Response:  Becket\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the details of the movie and the plot summary and idenitfy which movie is being described.\n","\n","    ### Context:\n","    Film Genre:['Romance Film', 'Drama', 'Indie'], Starring the actors: ['Susan Sarandon', 'Carey Mulligan', 'Aaron Johnson', 'Pierce Brosnan', 'Johnny Simmons', 'Zo√´ Kravitz', 'Lindsay Beamish', 'James Biberi', 'Hannah Hodson', 'Javier Picayo', 'Cara Seymour', 'Michael Shannon', 'Carey Mulligan'], Released in the year: 2009, Summary of the movie plot: When Bennett Brewer  dies, his family feel like they cannot go on.

Though there is a nod to the classic Holmes in a scene where Holmes and Watson are leaving 221b Baker Street, and Holmes picks up his deerstalker. Watson protests, and Holmes reluctantly puts on a fedora instead. Holmes is called into the \"Inner Council\" of British Intelligence by Sir Evan Barham ([[Reginald Denny , to assist in stopping Nazi saboteurs operating in Britain, whose activities are announced in advance in radio broadcasts by \"The Voice of Terror\". Gavin ([[Robert Barron , one of Holmes's operatives, is killed with a German dagger in his back. Before he dies, Gavin utters the word \"Christopher.\" Later, Holmes and Watson go to the Limehouse district of London, where they meet with Gavin's wife Kitty . Holmes tells the council that, through the use of an oscilloscope to carefully analyze and compare sound wave patterns from radio broadcasts of live vs. pre-recorded voices, he has determined that \"The Voice of Terror\" is actually recorded on phonograph records in England, but broadcast from Germany. Using a tip from Kitty, Holmes and Watson go to the old Christopher Docks, where they are followed by Sir Anthony Lloyd  of the council. The three men are captured by a group of Nazi spies led by a man named Meade , although Meade manages to escape through a trap door to a waiting speedboat. Kitty pretends to be a thief on the run and joins Meade. She finds out that Meade plans to go to Sir Evan's country estate that night. There Holmes and Sir Evan watch a German plane attempt to land, but gunshots fired by Sir Evan disrupt the Nazi rendezvous, all the while Meade hides in the dark. After one of Holmes informants traces Meade and Kitty to the south coast of England, Holmes forces the council to go there with him. With the support of British troopers, Holmes captures Meade and a group of German soldiers stationed in an abandoned church. There he reveals the true identity of \"The Voice of Terror\" as Sir Evan Barham, who happens to be an impostor. Holmes then reveals that in World War I, the real Barham was a prisoner in a German war camp and had an uncanny resemblance to a Heinrich Von Bork, a member of the German Secret Service; one day the real Barham was taken out executed; the gentleman who called Holmes into the case was Von Bork himself who had posing as Barham for 24 years; Holmes then adds that Barham had no immediate family, so his private life was well studied by Von Bork, who also studied at Oxford and had knowledge of the English language and manners. So, with a little help of plastic surgery, not to mention the resemblance to Barham in the first place, the deception was carried out thoroughly. Holmes also concludes that the real Sir Evan Barham carried a scar from childhood, the one Von Bork carried from plastic surgery was approximately 20 years old - the clue that gave away the fact that he was an impostor. Holmes then informs the spies that the German invasion force has been destroyed. The angry Meade shoots and fatally wounds Kitty, but is killed himself as he attempts to escape. The Council stand around the murdered Kitty and swear that her heroic death will not be in vain. The film ends with a direct quote from \"His Last Bow\": :Watson: It's a lovely morning, Holmes. :Holmes: There's an East wind coming, Watson. :Watson: I don't think so. Looks like another warm day. :Holmes: Good old Watson. The one fixed point in a changing age. But there's an East wind coming all the same. Such a wind as never blew on England yet. It will be cold and bitter, Watson, and a good many of us may wither before its blast. But it's God's own wind none the less. And a greener, better, stronger land will be in the sunshine when the wind is cleared.Davies, David Stuart, Holmes of the Movies  ISBN 450 03358 9\n","\n","    ### Response: 221B Baker Street\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the details of the movie and the plot summary and idenitfy which movie is being described.\n","\n","    ### Context:\n","    Film Genre:['Comedy-drama', 'Comedy'], Starring the actors: information not available, Released in the year: 1994, Summary of the movie plot: Ten years after having left high school, four friends, Momo, L√©on, Alain and Bruno meet for the birth of the child of their friend Tomasi, who recently died.

She works at Rio de Janeiro's Central Station, writing letters for illiterate customers, in order to make ends meet. She can be impatient with her customers and sometimes does not mail the letters she writes, putting them in a drawer or even tearing them up. Josu√© is a poor 9-year-old boy who has never met his father, but hopes to do so. His mother sends letters to his father through Dora, saying that she hopes to reunite with him soon, but when she is killed in a bus accident just outside the train station, the boy is left homeless. Dora takes him in and traffics him to a corrupt couple, but she is made to feel guilty by her neighbor and friend Irene and later steals him back. Dora is initially reluctant to be responsible for the boy, but ends up deciding to take a trip with him to Northeast Brazil in order to find his father's house and leave him there. Dora tries to leave Josu√© on the bus, but he follows her, forgetting his backpack containing Dora's money. Penniless, they are picked up by a kind, Evangelical truck driver who abandons them when Dora encourages him to drink beer and then grows too friendly. Dora trades her watch for a ride to Bom Jesus on the back of a truck. They find his father's address in Bom Jesus, but the current residents say that Jesus won a house in the lottery, and now lives in the new settlements, adding that he lost the house and money through drinking. With no money, Josu√© saves them from destitution by suggesting Dora write letters for the pilgrims who have arrived in Bom Jesus for a massive pilgrimage. This time she posts the letters. They take the bus to the settlements, but when they locate the address they have for Josu√©'s father, they are told by the new residents that he no longer lives there and has disappeared. Josu√© tells Dora that he will wait for him, but Dora invites him to live with her. She calls Irene in Rio and asks her to sell her refrigerator, sofa and television. She says that she will call when she gets settled somewhere. After she hangs up, she learns that there are no buses leaving until the next morning. Isa√≠as, one of Josu√©'s half-brothers, is working on a roof next to the bus stop, and learns that they are looking for his father. After introducing himself, Dora says that she is a friend of his father and was in the area. Isa√≠as insists that she and Josu√©, who, suspicious of the stranger, has introduced himself as Geraldo, come to dinner. They return to his house, where they meet Mois√©s, the other half-brother. Later, Isa√≠as explains to Dora that their father married Ana, who he doesn't know is Josu√©'s mother, after their mother died, and that nine years ago, while pregnant, Ana left her drunken lover for Rio and never returned. Isa√≠as asks Dora to read a letter his father wrote to Ana when he disappeared, six months ago, in case she returned. In the letter, the boys' father explains that he has gone to Rio to find Ana and the son he has never met. He promises to return, asks her to wait for him, and says they can all be together -- himself, Ana, Isa√≠as and Mois√©s. At this point Dora pauses, looks at Josu√© and says, \"and Josu√©, whom I can't wait to meet.\" Isa√≠as and Josu√© both say that he will return, but Mois√©s doesn't think so. The next morning, while the sons sleep, Dora sneaks out to catch the bus for Rio. She first leaves beside the letter from Jesus the one from Ana to Jesus, the one Dora carried with her from the Central Station but never mailed, expressing Ana's wish for the family to be reunited. Josu√© wakes up too late to prevent her departure. Dora writes a letter to Josu√© on the bus. Both are left with the photos they had taken by which to remember one another.\n","\n","    ### Response: 100 Years of Solitude\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the details of the movie and the plot summary and idenitfy which movie is being described.\n","\n","    ### Context:\n","    Film Genre:['Road movie', 'Musical', 'Drama', 'Comedy', 'Musical Drama'], Starring the actors: ['Joe Regalbuto', 'Kyle Eastwood', 'Tim Thomerson', 'Barry Corbin', 'Clint Eastwood', 'John McIntire', 'Jerry Hardin', 'Verna Bloom', 'Alexa Kenin'], Released in the year: 1982, Summary of the movie plot: Would-be western singer Red Stovall , suffers from tuberculosis and has finally been given an opportunity to make it big at the Grand Ole Opry.

Pilot Bill Brooks , co-pilot Joe , and steward Larry  comprise the crew. A fierce nighttime storm buffets their airliner. A gas cylinder comes loose and is thrown against the door, forcing it open; Larry falls out to his death. An engine fails and the pilots are forced to crash-land in the jungle. In the morning, the professor recognizes the plants of the Amazon rainforest. The aircraft has been blown far south of where rescuers would search, and the nearest civilization is across the mountains; but there is water where they are, and enough fruit and game to live on. Weeks go by while Bill and Joe struggle to repair the damaged aircraft, and the others clear a runway. The experience changes everyone. The Spenglers rediscover their love for each other. Bill warms to an appreciative Peggy, although she tells him about her past. Judson goes to pieces, staying drunk much of the time, while Alice toughens up, and begins to feel attracted to Joe. The biggest change is in Vasquez. Seeing how well most of the group have coped with their situation, he reconsiders his radical beliefs. On the 23rd day, Crimp disappears. It is Tommy who eventually discovers him. When Peggy and Pete go looking for the boy, he leads them to the body, which has a poison dart in it. Pete orders Peggy to take Tommy to safety while he covers their retreat, and is also killed by the unseen natives. The remaining survivors board the now-repaired aircraft, but as the engines rev up, an oil leak develops. Bill and Joe patch it, but realize that it will fail some time after takeoff, leaving only one working engine. As a result, the aircraft can only carry four adults and Tommy across the mountains. As everyone tries to decide how to choose who will stay and who will face the hostile natives, Vasquez suddenly grabs a gun and announces that, since he is doomed no matter what, he is the only one without bias and will make the decisions. He will think about it until the plane is ready. While thinking, he is approached by Professor Spengler, who says he and his wife have lived their lives and should stay, and by Judson, who tries to bribe Vasquez by offering to pay for a top lawyer. When the aircraft is ready, Vasquez announces that both pilots and both of the younger women will go along with Tommy. Judson attacks him and Vasquez shoots him dead. The aircraft takes off, leaving Vasquez and the Spenglers. As the natives approach, Professor Spengler quietly informs Vasquez that must not be taken alive, as they will be tortured. Vasquez lies to him, telling him that there are three bullets left. He kills the couple with his last two bullets, and waits for his grisly fate.\n","\n","    ### Response: 20th Century Dawn\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the details of the movie and the plot summary and idenitfy which movie is being described.\n","\n","    ### Context:\n","    Film Genre:['Romantic comedy', 'Coming of age', 'Indie', 'Drama', 'Comedy', 'Black comedy'], Starring the actors: ['Sabine Singh', 'Devon Gummersall', 'Dylan Bruno', 'Katharine Towne', 'John Savage', 'Gina Philips', 'Johnny Whitworth', 'Richard Blackburn', 'Steve Van Wormer'], Released in the year: 2002, Summary of the movie plot:  The story is narrated by the protagonist, Puck , who begins with a monologue describing the basic reasoning underlying his philosophy, as well as the movie's general interpretation of Anarchism, as he walks through the commune he lives in, while events of his daily life are presented.

Throughout the movie this group is referred to as \"The Family,\" and their way of life is described as peaceful and happy, until the day Johnny Black, a mysterious, militant nihilist with a forceful personality, appears. Johnny Black shares much of the rebellious philosophy of \"the family\" when he shows up, however he disrespects what he sees as the narrow minded and shortsighted protest tactics Johnny Red espouses. However, politically weak within the framework of the Family, Black cannot challenge Red's authority for the time being. Frustrated and unhappy with his social life and lack of direction, Puck seeks a girlfriend. He eventually meets a young woman at a night club, Jody, who he learns is a young Republican college student. However, when his new observations of Jody's political beliefs and academic success causes him greater internal conflict and personal embarrassment, Puck decides to temporarily leave the Family and ventures out to find a new job and home. Still unhappy and directionless, Puck opts to return to the Family.  In the time that has transpired in Puck's absence, Black's influence over the family has steadily grown. Encouraging the group to forge alliances with \"like-minded\" organizations. Over time, Black undergoes a more militant shift in personality. At a meeting for a planned protest demonstration against a petrochemical plant, Black denounces the peaceful, non-violent approach most of the attendants support, and presents two tools to be used in their attack on the plant: semtex and The Anarchist Cookbook. Johnny Red describes the book as \"a relic from the past... it taught you how to make bombs, how to make drugs... and it meant something once.\" He also accurately mentions that the author, William Powell, has disavowed the book. He continues, commenting, \"the book's not the problem. The problem is the kind of people who look to it for answers.\" A few days afterward, Johnny Black discovers Red's private journal, in which he admits to being sexually attracted to young boys. He places this in the open for Gin to discover, and after reading a passage in which Red admits to his pedophilia, she dumps him. Following this, Red's personality becomes more anxious and submissive to Black. One day, while carrying science kits, Puck, Double D, and Sweeney are approached by a police officer who randomly stops them and requests to inspect their contents. After complying, they receive a ride from the officer to Sam, explaining that their run down house is in fact an orphanage the kits are intended for. The officer decides to visit the building, and enters to discover Karla in the midst of using cocaine with Johnny Black. The entire group, except for Johnny Red, is promptly arrested and brought to trial, the presiding judge ironically being a spurned, former lover of Karla. The flop house, Sam, is shut down by the city; Johnny Black receives time at a medium security prison, with the possibility for parole in four months; Sweeney and Double D each receive 250 hours of community service; Karla, aside from being insulted by the judge, is made to receive a mandatory psychiatric evaluation; and Puck is placed under house arrest for 180 days, and forced to move into his parent's home in the city of Plano, Texas. Puck chafes in his suburban life, but comes to accept it with Jody's encouragement, until Johnny Black is paroled after four months. Black appears in Puck's apartment and easily convinces Puck to remove the ankle bracelet that tracks him and rejoin the Family.  Puck soon discovers that Karla, Sweeney, and Double D are all suffering from drug addiction, and have relocated to a new squat which they name \"Son of Sam\". The next stage of Johnny Black's strategy for his movement is the creation of a coalition of organizations which agree with any facet of his goals. However, these include extremist, conservative groups, such as neo-nazis and militia men. Black offers The Anarchist Cookbook as an instructional booklet to the other groups, while they pledge to offer various arms and explosives, and plans a \"joint mission\" to attack a local university. Puck attempts to leave the organization, but is under constant surveillance. He commits to remaining in the group, so as to watch over Double D, for whom he feels responsible. This situation eventually ends in tragedy when Double D overdoses on diazepam. Puck finally resolves to escape from the group and prevent the mission, and convinces a sober Sweeney and Johnny Red to help. Together, they devise a plan to intoxicate the extremist group members with pancakes laced with the very drugs Double D overdosed on. Once the entire organization is unconscious, the surviving members of the Family split up. Alone, Puck decides that once the group awakens he'd be in immediate danger, and so decides to report the organization and cooperate fully with the FBI, for which he receives a reward of $200,000. Immediately afterward, Puck considers his options and realizing that he now has the money and time to commit to his future, decides to take Jody's advice and return to college. Alone, he begins to hitchhike to California to join Jody as she interns at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. Receiving a ride from a truck driver, Puck is asked what his name is, and after some internal thinking, decides to accept his legal name and chosen name together: \"Peter Puck.\" The final monologue by Puck meditates over his new perspective on life and his personal philosophy, and renounces the concept of \"freedom without responsibility,\" which contrasts with his idealistic opening-sequence monologue.\n","\n","    ### Response: 20th Century Dream\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the details of the movie and the plot summary and idenitfy which movie is being described.\n","\n","    ### Context:\n","    Film Genre:['Action/Adventure', 'Action', 'Drama', 'War film'], Starring the actors: ['Juris Sulit', 'Mickey Rooney', \"Hugh O'Brian\", 'Harry Lauter', 'Peter Masterson', 'Gregg Amsterdam', 'Jim Anauo', 'James Mitchum', 'Amado Abello', 'Clem Stadler', 'Tony Smith', 'Max Quismundo'], Released in the year: 1966, Summary of the movie plot: Prior to the 1944 American invasion of the Philippines a hand picked team of U.S. Marine Corps amphibious reconnaissance scouts is landed by a PBY Catalina with the mission of contacting an intelligence agent who has crucial information. Each Marine is not only experienced but has a special skill with the exception of the radio operator, PFC Grenier . Grenier, an air crew radioman with only six months in the Corps is taken off the PBY's air crew when the original radio operator suddenly became medically unfit for the mission. He is given the sick Marine's radio and camouflage jacket to carry on his first ground combat mission. He serves as a narrator to the audience. After meeting up with their guide , the patrol commander Captain Alonzo Davis  is killed while ambushing a small group of Japanese soldiers, and First Sergeant Corey  takes command. Pvt. George George and Pfc. Henry Reynolds are killed while taking out a Japanese tank and patrol. And Cpl. Stanley Parrish is killed by a guerrilla trap soon after. As they walk on, Amado is shot by a Japanese officer while scaling a small hill. The marines let him die to keep their presence secret. Grenier is eventually told by Gunnery Sergeant Wartell  that they were sent to recover some important information from a contact in a tea house whose radio was destroyed, thus explaining the radio's importance to the mission. Grenier's inexperience and incompetence arouses anger amongst Corey and the other members of the patrol. His only friend is easy going but professional Gunnery Sergeant Wartell who acts as a mediator between the hard no nonsense 1st Sgt Corey and Grenier, explaining each one to the other and the audience. Rooney provides the only comedy relief in the film when his character is captured and interrogated by a group of careless Japanese soldiers. The surviving squad members eventually arrive at the tea house but, unfortunately, Amado was the one who was supposed to meet the contact as he was the only Filipino in the group. Desperate, the group sends Corey to met the contact, Miyazaki a Filipino-American woman from Long Beach, California. While sneaking out of the camp with Miyazaki, Corey crashes into a waiter and the two run across a straw bridge then blow it up with a grenade, escaping from the soldiers. Meanwhile, a large skirmish with a Japanese patrol has killed Cpl. Alvin Ross and Platoon Sergeant William Maccone, shot the radio up beyond repair, and wounded Gunnery Sergeant Wartell. Wartell, knowing he will slow the survivors down, tells the reluctant Corey to leave him behind. When they leave, he plants grenades under himself and is captured by the Japanese soldiers. After toying with them a bit during his interrogation he sets off the grenades, taking them all out in the blast, and leaving Corey and Grenier the only surviving marines. The explosion is heard by the survivors and they sadly track on. Corey and Grenier learn from Miyazaki that the Japanese are expecting the invasion fleet and have placed a mine field powerful enough to destroy the entire fleet in the water around the invasion sites. Arriving at a friendly Filipino village, Corey and Grenier are able to escape a Japanese patrol by boat. But Miyazaki is killed by an officer she seduced to buy the guys some time. At last discovering the principles of mission accomplishment, altruism, and self sacrifice through observation, Grenier becomes a squared away Marine. He and his First Sergeant infiltrate the enemy base to remotely detonate the minefield with the Japanese radio transmitter. As Corey provides a one man army diversion, Grenier is able to detonate the mines by radio control. Grenier then steals a radio and goes to tell Corey of their success, only to find Corey dead of blood loss from wounds he got while holding off the Japanese. Grenier escapes to the coast and radios for pick up. Leaving him the sole survivor of the mission. The movie ends with Grenier looking at the ocean while he listens to General Macarthur speech as he awaits pick up.\n","\n","    ### Response: 100 Rifles\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the details of the movie and the plot summary and idenitfy which movie is being described.\n","\n","    ### Context:\n","    Film Genre:['Comedy'], Starring the actors: ['Bebe Neuwirth', 'Whoopi Goldberg', 'Dianne Wiest', 'Timothy Daly', '≈Ωeljko Ivanek', 'Lee Wilkof', 'Austin Pendleton', 'Allison Janney', 'George Martin', 'Jean De Baer', 'Eli Wallach', 'George Morfogen', 'Helen Hanft', 'Miles Chapin', 'Lainie Kazan', 'Kenny Kerr', 'Frederick Rolf', 'Robert Levine'], Released in the year: 1996, Summary of the movie plot: Investment banker Laurel Ayres is a smart and single woman trying to make it up the Wall Street corporate ladder, until one day she finds out that she is passed over for a promotion because she is a woman.

Coe is found dead the next morning in his bedroom, locked from the inside. District Attorney Markham , Police Sergeant Heath  and everyone else assume it was suicide since he was shot through the head and was found holding a pistol. However, Vance is not convinced. He soon finds evidence that shows that Coe was murdered. Coroner Dr. Doremus  determines the victim died of a stab wound. There is no shortage of suspects; Coe was very much disliked. His niece Hilda Lake  resented her uncle's tight control of her finances and jealousy of any men who showed interest in her. Her boyfriend, Sir Thomas MacDonald , suspected Coe of killing his dog to ensure winning the competition. Raymond Wrede , the dead man's secretary, was in love with Miss Lake, but had been laughed at when he sought Coe's support. Coe's next door neighbor and lover Doris Delafield  had been cheating on him with Eduardo Grassi . When Coe found out, he canceled a contract to sell his collection of Chinese artworks to the Milan museum for which Grassi worked. Liang , the cook, had worked long, hard and illegally to help Coe amass his collection. He warned his employer against the proposed sale and was fired as a result. Even Coe's own brother Brisbane ([[Frank Conroy  made it clear that he despised him. Finally Gamble , the head servant, had concealed his criminal past. Brisbane Coe becomes Vance's prime suspect. His alibi of taking a train at the time of the murder is disproved. However, when he is found dead in a closet, Vance is both puzzled and enlightened. Among Brisbane's effects, Vance finds a book titled Unsolved Murders; a bookmarked page details a method of using string to lock a door through the keyhole without leaving a trace. Part of the mystery is solved. Later, an attempt is made on the life of Sir Thomas using the same dagger used to kill Coe. Finally, a Doberman Pinscher belonging to Miss Delafield is found seriously injured, apparently struck with a fireside poker. From these and other clues, Vance finally solves the crime. It turns out that two men had sought Coe's life that night. The successful murderer had struggled with Coe, stabbed him, and left him apparently dead. However, Coe awakened soon after. Too dazed to recall the fight and notice that he was mortally wounded, he went upstairs to his bedroom and opened his window before dying. Brisbane entered the chamber, saw his brother apparently asleep in his chair. He shot the corpse and arranged the scene to look like a suicide. However, downstairs he ran into the actual killer, who had seen that Archer Coe was still alive and came back to finish the job. In the darkness, he mistook Brisbane for Archer and killed the wrong man. Delafield's dog then wandered in, attracted by the commotion, and attacked the murderer. While sure of the killer's identity, Vance has no proof. He therefore arranges for Sir Thomas and Wrede to quarrel over Hilda Lake. When Wrede instinctively reaches for the poker to strike his rival, the healed Doberman which Vance had brought recognizes its attacker and leaps on him. Wrede confesses he became enraged when Coe refused to assist his courtship of Miss Lake, precipitating the initial stabbing.\n","\n","    ### Response: 13 Hours by Air\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the details of the movie and the plot summary and idenitfy which movie is being described.\n","\n","    ### Context:\n","    Film Genre:['World cinema', 'Musical', 'Drama', 'Romantic drama', 'Romance Film', 'Bollywood'], Starring the actors: ['Akshay Kumar', 'Kareena Kapoor', 'Aftab Shivdasani', 'Amrita Arora', 'Sylvester Stallone', 'Denise Richards', 'Amrita Arora', 'Boman Irani', 'Ashwin Mushran', 'Jaaved Jaffrey', 'Kirron Kher', 'Rajesh Khanna'], Released in the year: 2008, Summary of the movie plot: When Hollywood stuntman Viraj Shergill  and medical student Simrita Rai  come across each other at his brother Lucky's  and her best friend Kamini's  hastily planned wedding ceremony, they instantly develop a dislike for each other. They both have a very low opinion of the opposite sex, and staunchly believe marriage is not the way to go for the two newlyweds, whom they try to discourage from proceeding further. Simrita convinces Kamini to test out her theory that men are after only one thing, by forcing Lucky to delay their marriage vows for three months. She is sure, Lucky will not be able to do so and this will prove to Kamini that Lucky is just another low-class male, like all others, and her claims of him being different than most men are unfounded. Viraj, upon hearing about this new development, tries to do the exact opposite. This results in a hilarious scene at a local disco bar, where Viraj lures Kamini with the hope of her finding Lucky with a \"girlfriend\" that he has planted in the lap of Lucky in order to make Kamini jealous. The plan backfires and Kamini and Lucky end up in divorce court where the judge puts them on a three month probation and marriage counselling. Meanwhile, Simrita and Viraj keep bumping into each other when they both travel to Italy independently; the former to make some quick cash as a model to pay for her medical bills, and the latter, with Lucky, to chill out and take a vacation from all of the marital stress Lucky has been facing back home. Upon returning home, Simrita is given a watch pendant by her Dolly Aunty  to wear as a good luck charm. The pendant hangs from a bracelet on her wrist. Viraj gets seriously hurt in an accident at work and is brought for emergency surgery to the hospital where Simrita is an intern. Much to each other's irritation, Simrita is given the charge to perform surgery on Viraj. After the surgery, while looking at the X-rays, she is horrified to discover that the watch on her wrist has accidentally ended up in Viraj's stomach. Simrita tries various ways of getting the watch out. During one such process, which fails, it becomes clear that Simrita is bitter about her perceived unfaithfulness of the two most prominent men from her childhood: her divorced father and her elder sister's ex-husband. By this time, Viraj is secretly beginning to fall in love with Simrita. Several days later, Simrita is successful in removing the watch from Viraj's stomach. Following the surgery, Viraj overhears the truth and leaves. Several days later, he proposes to Denise Richards in an attempt to forget about Simrita. Upon realizing her mistake, Simrita helps Lucky and Kamini reconcile and decides to confess her love for Viraj at the wedding ceremony. At first, Denise is upset but then tells Viraj to go to Simrita. The two embrace and go off together in the car sharing a few passionate kisses.\n","\n","    ### Response: 3 Deewarein\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the details of the movie and the plot summary and idenitfy which movie is being described.\n","\n","    ### Context:\n","    Film Genre:['Romance Film', 'Drama'], Starring the actors: ['Aarathi'], Released in the year: 1973, Summary of the movie plot: The movie begins with Sanskrit saying, 'kaamaaturaaNam nabhayam nalajja ,' and the rest of the movie attempts to illustrate the same. Kama is one of the six moral weaknesses: kama , krodha , lobha , moha , madha  and matsara . Jayanthi, who somehow manages to carry herself despite being a little too well-fed, begins with a song expressing pangs of separation with her soldier-husband. The song -- 'Viraha,' is a classic in Kannada movie lore, and is quite often interjected in banter to express estrangement. As the song ends with the return of her husband, it becomes evident that the war has not just crippled his leg. Subsequently, the trauma of a marriage bereft of a physical relationship is portrayed in sing-song histrionics prevalent in movies of this period. The introduction of the brash, loud, motorbike-riding Nanjunda, infuses enthusiasm into a hitherto hurried and jarring narrative. Nanjunda, a fresh college graduate, also happens to be the Captain's neighbor. A word on topography and co-ordinates is in order here. The movie appears to be depicting Kodagu  as inferred by the frequently portrayed undulating hills, and typical Kodava dresses. The Captain and Nanjunda, own adjoining estates in this region. Nanjunda is on a visit, and seems to indulge in little but bike-riding and indolence. His dad's estate is managed by his uncle, Shivaram, another stentorian voice that strains the eardrums. The next part is the heart of the movie where Kanagal shines through with his trademark symbolism and narrative restraint. Many sequences are edited to be suggestive but incomplete, leaving just enough room to make it imaginative, but not enough to make vague. Nanjunda and the couple  move from being well-acquainted to being cosy friends through card-games and raucous, if unnecessary, laughter. And then it happens. Madhavi and Nanjunda embark on a picnic to Edakallu gudda , a desolate hilltop that houses a cavern, and has a little pond in it to boot. Though merely playful to begin with, proximity and solitude combine to tempt them, and Madhavi, in a moment of weakness falls prey to lust. If Nanjunds seduced her has no objective answer. Kanagal's subsequent portrayal of the uneasy relationship between Nanjunda and Madhavi deserves merit for its transitional nature. Nanjunda's infatuation in the immediate aftermath of the their first corporeal encounter, Madhavi's tortured complaisance in furthering the passion, till a fog of guilt and doom descends on her, are excellent in injecting a dash of reality. As the confused relationship teeters, a twist arrives in the form of Devaki, Madhavi's sister who arrives to stay with her sister. Nanjunda is immediately enamoured, and switched allegiance in a trice. But Devaki proves a harder nut to crack, and his advances are spurned with minimal effort. As a hapless onlooker to this courtship, Madhavi's welling emotions brimmeth over, adding anger and betrayal to guilt and remorse. Meanwhile, Nanjunda achieves a breakthrough as he machinates a picnic to, where else‚ÄîEdakallu gudda, with Devaki. He isn't as lucky this time. As Nanjunda gets more desperate in wooing Devaki, and Madhavi gets even more desperate in protecting her sister, things come to a head. The cat is let out of the bag in the form of too audible a meow emanating from Nanjunda's bedroom -- that Madhavi creates and  Devaki overhears. An interspersed song with the two sisters as muses, is pleasant for its departure from being a typical male-female duet. The climax is best left to the viewer.\n","\n","    ### Response: 999\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the details of the movie and the plot summary and idenitfy which movie is being described.\n","\n","    ### Context:\n","    Film Genre:['Action/Adventure', 'Historical fiction', 'Drama', 'Adventure'], Starring the actors: ['Raoul Trujillo', 'Lothaire Bluteau', 'Sandrine Holt', 'Tantoo Cardinal', 'Gordon Tootoosis', 'August Schellenberg', 'Aden Young', 'Billy Two Rivers'], Released in the year: 1991, Summary of the movie plot: Set in 1634, the film begins in the tiny French settlement that will one day become Quebec City. Jesuit missionaries are trying to encourage the local Algonquin Indians to embrace Christianity, with thus far only limited results. Samuel de Champlain, founder of the settlement, sends Father LaForgue, a young Jesuit priest, to find a distant Catholic mission in a Huron village. LaForgue is accompanied on his journey by a non-Jesuit assistant, Daniel, and a group of Algonquin Indians whom Champlain has ordered to guide him to the Huron village. This group includes Chomina  - an older, experienced traveller who has clairvoyant dreams; his wife ; and Annuka , their daughter. As they journey across the lakes and forests, Daniel and Annuka fall in love, to the discomfort of the celibate LaForgue. The group meet with a band of Montagnais Indians who have never met Frenchmen before. The Montagnais shaman is suspicious  of LaForgue's influence over the Algonquins. He accuses him of being a devil. He encourages Chomina and the other Algonquins to abandon the two Frenchmen and travel instead to a winter hunting lodge. This they do, paddling away from the Frenchmen. LaForgue accepts his fate, but Daniel is determined to stay with Annuka and follows the Indians as they march across the forest. When one Indian tries to shoot Daniel, Chomina is consumed by guilt at having betrayed Champlain's trust. He and a few other members of the Algonquin tribe return with Daniel to try to find LaForgue. As they recover LaForgue, a party of Iroquois attacks them, killing Chomina's wife and taking the rest captive. They are taken to an Iroquois fortress, where they are beaten and told they will be slowly tortured to death, only after Chomina's young son is killed before his eyes. Annuka helps them escape by seducing a guard with sex. Chomina, dying of a wound from his capture, freezes to death in the snow; LaForgue tries, unsuccessfully, to persuade Chomina to embrace Christ before he dies. When Chomina dies, he sees the She-Manitou appearing to him. Annuka and Daniel take LaForgue to the outskirts of the Huron settlement, but leave him to enter it alone, because Chomina had dreamed that this must happen. LaForgue finds all but one of the French inhabitants dead, murdered by the Hurons who blamed them for a smallpox epidemic. The leader of the last survivors tells LaForgue that the Hurons are dying, and he should offer to save them by baptizing them. LaForgue confronts the Hurons. When their leader asks LaForgue if he loves them, LaForgue thinks of the faces of all the Indians he has met on his journey, and answers \"Yes\". The leader then asks him to baptize them, and the Hurons accept Christianity. The film ends with a golden sunrise. An intertitle explains that fifteen years later, the Huron were massacred by the Iroquois, and the French mission was destroyed.\n","\n","    ### Response: 1492: Conquest of Paradise\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the details of the movie and the plot summary and idenitfy which movie is being described.\n","\n","    ### Context:\n","    Film Genre:['Coming of age', 'Drama', 'Political thriller'], Starring the actors: ['Jafta Mamabolo', 'Sihle Xaba', 'Tshepang Mohlomi', 'Kenneth Nkosi', 'Harriet Manamela', 'Hamilton Dhlamini', 'Nolwazi Shange', 'Thomas Gumede'], Released in the year: 2011, Summary of the movie plot: It is 1989, and the struggle against apartheid has reached its peak.

Long ago in the city of Jinzhao, Rhino , Ox  and Croc  are small-time pit fighters who attracted the attention of Grand Master Oogway , who, seeing their talent and focus, wished them to find something worthy to fight for. As the trio fought themselves to a standstill, two of the villainous Wu Sisters were freeing their leader and eldest sister Su Wu . To recapture them, Oogway persuades Rhino, Ox and Croc into helping him find the sisters at Hubei Volcano. However, to his disappointment, Oogway has to appeal to them with vague prospects of being put on a path to riches to get that cooperation. While the Wu Sisters plot to unite the various criminal gangs to seize control of China, Master Oogway has to brush off each of his compatriot's petty proposals during the journey to abandon the others for their benefit. At camp, Oogway eventually discovers that while Croc and Ox are motivated by narcissism and greed respectively, Rhino has a deep-seated need to win his dad Master Flying Rhino's  respect. To that, Oogway suggests to all of them that their current goals will only keep them wanting more, and changing their ways can lead to better lives for all. Before the trio can comprehend Oogway's point, a messenger bird from the Sisters arrives to reveal their plan and Oogway has the company set off immediately. To encourage them to change their ways, Master Oogway secretly leads the trio into an extremely dangerous path and forces them to cooperate in order for them all to safely pass to illustrate his point of selflessness. However, when the trio finally learn that Oogway was being metaphorical about his promise of riches, their protests accidentally get them trapped on a river of lava. Oogway manages to get them to safe ground, but he falls over a lava fall, leaving them with only the advice \"Remember the path\" to guide them now.

The film shows the story of a bereaved Queen Victoria  and her relationship with a Scottish servant, John Brown , and the subsequent uproar it provoked. Brown had been a trusted servant of Victoria's then deceased and beloved Prince Consort, Prince Albert; Victoria's chief servants thought Brown might help to ease an inconsolable Queen since the Prince Consort's death in 1861. In 1863, hoping to subtly coax the Queen toward resuming public life after years of seclusion, Mr. Brown is summoned to court. The plan succeeds a little too well for the servants' liking, especially Victoria's chief secretary Sir Henry Ponsonby (played by [[Geoffrey Palmer  and The Prince of Wales  as well as other members of the Royal family; the public, press and politicians soon come to resent Brown's perceived influence over the queen. Brown takes considerable liberties with court protocol, especially by addressing Her Majesty as \"woman\". He also quickly takes control over the Queen's daily activities, further aggravating the tensions between himself and the royal family and servants. The moniker \"Mrs. Brown\", used both at the time and in the film, implied an improper, and perhaps sexual, relationship. The film does not directly address the contemporary suspicions that the Queen and Brown had had a sexual relationship and perhaps had even secretly married (see the article on [[John Brown , though cartoons from the satirical magazine Punch are shown as being passed around in Parliament . As a result of Victoria's virtual recluse, especially at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, something initially encouraged by Brown, her popularity is failing and there is a growing rise in republican sentiment. Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli  has a weakening hold over the House of Commons and a fear of rising anti-monarchical sentiment in the country. He persuades Brown to use his influence with the Queen and persuade her to return to the performance of her public duties, especially the speech from the throne at the impending opening of Parliament. Brown is reluctant to do so, rightly fearing that Victoria will take this as a personal betrayal. When Brown urges Victoria to return to London and fulfill her public duties, an argument ensues. Feeling betrayed by Brown, the Queen becomes enraged. She can't believe what she is hearing. When Brown once again refers to her as \"woman\", she sharply rebukes him. Leaving the room, she turns to Ponsonby and Jenner requesting that they serve her needs, clearly reducing Mr. Brown's contact and influence over her. Their relationship was never to be the same again. The Queen's eventual acquiescence and her decision to return to public life eventually leads to a revitalization of her popularity and a resurgence in public support of the monarchy. Brown continues to serve Queen Victoria, until his death in 1883. In his final years, his duties become reduced to head of security. The palace staff has become weary of Brown's dogmatic ways and they mock and rebuke his security efforts as paranoid delusions. Finally, during a public event, a gun wielding assassin appears out of the crowd leaping toward the royal family. An ever vigilant Mr. Brown successfully thwarts the assassination attempt. At dinner the next evening, the Prince of Wales retells the story, bragging to their dinner companions that he had been the one to warn Brown of the assassin. Seeing through her son's bragging, the Queen announces instead that a special medal for bravery, the \"Devoted Service Medal,\" will be minted and awarded to Mr. Brown. Some years later, Mr. Brown becomes gravely ill with pneumonia after chasing through the woods late at night searching for a possible intruder. Hearing of Brown's illness, the Queen visits Mr. Brown's room and is visibly shaken to see her old friend so ill. Placing a cool damp cloth against Brown's fevered brow, she confesses that she has not been as good a friend as she might have been in recent years. It is clear that her apology is accepted by Brown. The pneumonia proves fatal for Brown and he passes away. During his years of service, Mr. Brown has kept a diary and upon his passing, Ponsonby and Dr. Jenner discuss its contents stating that it must never be seen by anyone. Holding the diary at his side, Ponsonby walks away and it's implied that the diary will be destroyed or will disappear. Dr. Jenner also reveals that the Prince of Wales has hurled the Queen's favorite bust of Mr. Brown up and over the \"palace wall\", referring us back to the film's opening sequence. The film's closing crawl informs us that: \"John Brown's diary was never found.\"\n","\n","    ### Response: 1997\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the details of the movie and the plot summary and idenitfy which movie is being described.\n","\n","    ### Context:\n","    Film Genre:['Thriller', 'Crime Fiction', 'Action'], Starring the actors: ['Mae Whitman'], Released in the year: , Summary of the movie plot: A young girl, Amy Tolliver, played by the amazingly talented Mae Whitman, is visiting her grandmother's cabin in a forested mountain area of Maine.

Lieutenant Alexis Rosanoff  of the Imperial Russian Air Force lands in Paris after a dangerous flight over enemy territory, bringing important dispatches from Russia. He persuades his superior, General Serge Shubin , to take him to see Mata Hari perform that night. Rosanoff is instantly smitten by her . By youthful exuberance and good looks, he persuades her to spend the night with him. However, the next morning, she makes it clear to him that it was a one-time dalliance. Carlotta  secretly instructs Mata Hari to report to Andriani , their spymaster. Andriani orders her to find out from General Shubin the contents of the dispatches Rosanoff brought. Meanwhile, when Dubois discloses his suspicions about Mata Hari to Shubin, the general laughs them off as ridiculous. However, Shubin has himself passed secret information to his lover Mata Hari, whom he is expecting for a private dinner. Rosanoff arrives unexpectedly, in case Shubin has further instructions before the pilot returns to Russia with more important dispatches.

When he wins a lot of money cheating at craps, he has to be rescued from a robbery attempt by a complete stranger, Ballin Mundson . Mundson tells him about an illegal high-class casino, but warns him not to practice his skills there. Farrell ignores his advice, cheats at blackjack, and is taken by two men to see the casino's owner, who turns out to be Mundson. Farrell talks Mundson into hiring him and quickly gains his confidence. However, the unimpressed washroom attendant, Uncle Pio , keeps calling him \"peasant\". One day, Mundson returns from a trip with a beautiful and spirited new wife, Gilda . It is immediately apparent that Johnny and Gilda have a history together, though both deny it when Mundson questions them. Johnny visits Gilda alone in the bedroom she shares with her husband, and the two have an explosive confrontation that elucidates both their past romantic relationship, which ended badly, and their love-hate dynamic. While it is unclear just how much Mundson knows of Gilda and Johnny's past relationship, he appears to be in ignorance when he assigns Farrell to keep an eye on Gilda. Johnny and Gilda are both consumed with their hatred of each other, as Gilda cavorts with men at all hours in increasingly more blatant efforts to enrage Johnny, and he grows more abusive and spiteful in his treatment of her. Meanwhile, Mundson is visited by two German businessmen. Their secret organization had financed a tungsten cartel, with everything put in Mundson's name to hide their connection to it. However, when they decide it is safe to take over, Mundson refuses to transfer ownership to his backers. The Argentine secret police are interested in the Germans; government agent Obregon  introduces himself to Farrell to try to obtain information, but the American knows nothing about that aspect of Mundson's operations. When the Germans return later, Mundson shoots and kills one of them. That same night, at Mundson's house, Farrell and Gilda have another hostile confrontation, which begins with them angrily declaring their hate for each other, and ends with them passionately kissing. Mundson arrives at that moment, then flees to a waiting airplane. Farrell and Obregon witness its short flight; the plane explodes shortly after takeoff and plummets into the ocean. However, Mundson has parachuted to safety, thus faking his death. With Mundson apparently dead, Gilda inherits his estate. Gilda and Johnny marry, but while Gilda married him for love, Johnny has married her to punish them both for their mutual betrayal of Mundson. He stays away, but has her guarded day and night out of contempt for her and loyalty to Mundson. Gilda tries to escape the tortured marriage a number of times , but Johnny is ultimately able to thwart every attempt, determined to keep her trapped in the relationship that has become a prison for them both. Finally, Obregon tells Farrell that Gilda was never truly unfaithful to Mundson or to him, prompting Farrell to try to reconcile with her. At that moment, Mundson reappears, armed with a gun. He faked his death to deceive the Nazis. Mundson tells them he will have to kill them both, but Uncle Pio manages to fatally stab him in the back. Obregon shows up, and Johnny tries to take the blame for the murder. Uncle Pio finally credits Johnny for being a true gentleman, while insisting that he had killed Mundson. Obregon reminds them both that Mundson had technically died years before, but there is also such a thing as justifiable homicide. Farrell gives Obregon the incriminating documents from Mundson's safe, and the police confiscate the estate for the government. Farrell and Gilda finally reconcile and confess their mutual love, and apologize for the many emotional wounds they have inflicted on each another.\n","\n","    ### Response:  Gilda\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the details of the movie and the plot summary and idenitfy which movie is being described.\n","\n","    ### Context:\n","    Film Genre:['Thriller', 'Drama', 'Crime Fiction', 'Social problem film', 'World cinema'], Starring the actors: ['Guilied Lopez', 'Catalina Sandino Moreno', 'Virgina Ariza', 'Yenny Paola Vega', 'Charles Albert Pati√±o', 'Wilson Guerrero', 'Johanna Andrea Mora', 'Evangelina Morales', 'John √Ålex Toro', 'Jaime Osorio G√≥mez', 'Ada Vergara de Solano', 'Maria Consuelo Perez', 'Ed Trucco', 'Patricia Rae'], Released in the year: 2004, Summary of the movie plot: 17-year-old Colombian girl Mar√≠a √Ålvarez works in sweat shop-like conditions at a flower plantation.

After she sings the first verse of \"Five O'Clock Whistle\" in the opening to establish this fact, Bugs pops out of her basket to ask where she's going. She replies that she's going to \"bring a little bunny rabbit to my grandma's. Ta HAVE, see?\" With this part of the story set up, the wolf is now introduced. The wolf switches a \"Shortcut to Grandma's\" sign, so that Red has to go through a long mountain path, while the wolf uses the real shortcut ‚Äì a few short steps to the house. Seeing a note on the door that Grandma isn't home , the wolf sneaks inside and dresses like grandma ‚Äì only to find that a bunch of other wolves are similarly dressed and waiting in the bed for Red! The wolf  growls for the others to \"COME ON! COME ON! take a powder ‚Äì this is MY racket!\" and the other wolves leave muttering to themselves, and a small wolf leaves from under the pillow. Once in bed, the wolf waits for Red to come to the door. But in a twist the wolf isn't interested in eating Red, but rather the rabbit she brought with her. The wolf quickly shuffles Red out the door and tries looking for Bugs. Bugs, however, gets the better of the wolf and runs around the house, being 'chased' by the wolf. Along the way, Bugs subjects the wolf to the famous lots-of-doors in-and-out routine .

However, the wolf manages to catch his feet on the ends of two benches just in time, doing the \"splits\", facing the camera. Instead of simply kicking one of the benches away, Bugs proceeds to dump heavy weights into the wolf's arms. After clearing out just about everything in the house , Bugs is about to apply the coup de grace on the wolf ‚Äì by placing an olive branch on top of the mass of junk and furniture the wolf is holding ‚Äì when Red comes back in, bellowing \"Hey, GRANDMA!\"  By this time, even Bugs has had enough of Red's interruptions, prompting him to say, \"I'll do it, but I'll probably hate myself in the morning.\" He descends the ladder, out of frame, there's a shuffling of the furniture... and now RED is the one desperately trying to avoid getting scorched , while Bugs and the wolf, arms around each other's shoulders, share a carrot and self-satisfied looks, and await the inevitable.\n","\n","    ### Response: 3 Little Bops\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the details of the movie and the plot summary and idenitfy which movie is being described.\n","\n","    ### Context:\n","    Film Genre:['Drama', 'Psychological thriller', 'Indie'], Starring the actors: ['Jonas Chernick', 'Lindy Booth', 'Callum Keith Rennie', 'Ross McMillan', 'Kristen Harris', 'Lauren Ritz', 'Michelle Nolden'], Released in the year: 2005, Summary of the movie plot: Joel Rothman  is suffering from insomnia after having massive problems in his personal life including a separation and being targeted by his boss.

the biases that permeate the corner of its society. whether it is communal bias, social bias, economic bias, religious bias or educational bias, the \"bias\" factor dominates the entire depiction of the film, merging different characters into one story. the different biases that are incorporated into the film are as following: #religious bias - a devout muslim listens to the radical sermons of a religious leader that aims to instigate his followers to take revenge for the wrongdoings occurring within the islamic community. this leads his followers to collaborate to create havoc in the city, but plans fail. however, when the plan is about to succeed, the follower decides to abort it, seeing a hindu boy walk towards it. this child had previously helped a lost muslim girl find her mother. #communal bias - rajpal yadav is a bihari who has just arrived in mumbai, looking for work. in his quest for some money and food, yadav encounters incredible bias against his community, with marathis blaming his creed for taking away jobs and others ridiculing his sub-par technical skills. on the other side, a brahmin politician opposes his son's courtship of a dalit girl; however, he decides to exploit the relationship for political gain. #social bias - sarika is the administrator of a large hospital, running it with zeal and fervor. seema biswas is a poor woman who is trying to gather funds for her husband's bail money, as he has been framed in a fraudulent case. biswas works at sarika's house, cooking meals and cleaning the house. despite seema's honest work, sarika continues to doubt her when things go missing, checking her purse and doubting her character. in the end, it is biswas who comes to the aid of sarika at a crucial moment. #gender bias - sarika's husband is a successful builder and owner of several call centre across mumbai. intoxicated with money and power, he finds himself unable to resist deflowering women, using every moment to lure women, by showering expensive gifts on them. however, a moment arrives where he finds himself on crossroads, unable to face the reality, but understanding its repercussions. #economic bias - perizaad zorabian is a successful creative head of a channel. however, work and life has tensed her. she is unable to bear the hectic pressure of mumbai and asks her husband to find work in either the united states or united kingdom. perizaad looks for opportunities to insult people and finds her financial power too strong to succumb to emotion. biases of these sort weave the entire story into finding resolutions based on the biases of individuals and the reality of the lifestyle of mumbai. the message clearly floated through movie is we have to learn to live together like brothers or perish like fools, as said by m. luther king. this movie plot has certain similarities with the plot of crash , an american movie starring matt dillon, sandra bullock, don cheadle, thandie newton and brendan fraser.{{cite

adopts the man's orphaned son. the boy, whom he names h. w. , becomes his nominal business \"partner\". nine years later, plainview is approached by paul sunday , who tells him about the oil deposit under his family's property in little boston, california. plainview attempts to buy the farm at a bargain price but paul's twin brother eli , wise to plainview's plan, holds out for $5,000, wanting the money to fund the local church, of which he is the pastor. plainview has eli's father agree to the bargain price instead, and goes on to acquire the available land in the area, except for one holdout, william bandy . oil production begins. later, an on-site accident kills a worker, and later still, a large explosion robs h. w. of his hearing. one day, a visitor  arrives on plainview's doorstep claiming to be his half-brother, henry, seeking work. plainview takes the stranger in, and though h. w. discovers flaws in his story, he keeps the news to himself; the boy then attempts to kill henry by setting his bed linen alight. angered at his son's behavior, plainview sends the boy away to a school in san francisco. a representative from standard oil offers to buy out plainview's local interests, but plainview elects to strike a deal with union oil and construct a pipeline to the california coast, though the bandy ranch remains an impediment. after spending more time with henry, plainview also becomes suspicious; henry confesses that he was actually a friend of the real henry, who had died from tuberculosis. plainview kills the imposter and buries his body. the next

the deal if eli confesses, \"i am a false prophet; god is a superstition\", subjecting eli to the same humiliation eli had put him through years earlier. eli does so after much berating by plainview. to eli's horror, plainview reveals that he had already drained the oil from the property through surrounding wells by saying, \"i drink your milkshake.\" plainview suddenly goes into a rage, chases eli about the room, and then beats him to death with a bowling pin. when plainview's butler comes down to check on him, plainview simply says \"i'm finished.\"\n","\n","    ### response:  there will

to accompany his young cousin guajiro  to a drug deal held at a bar. guajiro is betrayed and killed by his suppliers and carlito is forced to shoot his way out. afterwards, carlito takes guajiro's $30,000 from the botched deal and uses it to buy into a nightclub owned by a gambling addict named saso  with the intent on saving $75,000 to retire to the caribbean. as nightclub co-owner, carlito declines several offers for a business partnership with an ambitious, albeit obnoxious, young gangster from the bronx named benny blanco . carlito also rekindles his romance with his former girlfriend gail , a ballet dancer who moonlights as a stripper. kleinfeld develops a love interest with benny's girlfriend, steffie, a waitress at carlito's nightclub. benny's frustration with carlito's constant rejections boils over and he confronts carlito one night at his table. carlito publicly humiliates benny, who reacts by manhandling steffie. fueled by his now extensive use of alcohol and cocaine, kleinfeld brazenly pulls out a gun and threatens to kill benny, but carlito intervenes. despite being personally threatened by benny himself, carlito lets benny go unharmed; a decision which alienates carlito's gangster friend and personal bodyguard pachanga . kleinfeld, who stole one million dollars in payoff money from his italian mob-boss client, anthony \"tony t\" taglialucci, is coerced into

out; carlito warns kleinfeld that he's crossed the line from being a lawyer to acting like a gangster, and other gangsters will treat him accordingly. carlito then buys train tickets to miami for

the small mining village of kitamatsu, on the outskirts of kyushu, two miners have gone missing. the two men, goro and yoshi, had brawled earlier that day, and no sooner had they entered the mine then the shaft had quickly flooded. shigeru kawamura , head of security at the mine, heads below to investigate. there, he and the local police make a gruesome discovery: yoshi's lacerated corpse. above ground, a doctor examines yoshi, and discovers the cause of death to be a series of deep gashes caused by an abnormally sharp object. as some of the miners comfort yoshi's wailing wife, the others discuss the possibility of goro's involvement in the death. the two had never been friends, and had physically fought that morning. also, goro was still missing, and could be on the run or still be hiding in the mine. shigeru warns them not to speak of this until the police investigation begins. outside, shigeru meets with his fiance kiyo , who is also goro's sister. he comforts her, telling her that he is sure of goro's innocence. inside the mine, three policemen stand guard at the edge of the water, knowing if goro tries to escape, he will surely come that way . suddenly, they hear a splash in the flooded mine, and venture into the water. as they wade deeper into the shaft, they get more and more nervous. all of a sudden, one of the policemen begins to scream and then disappears under the water. as the men are tied together, is is not to long before another is pulled under by something beneath the surface. the last policeman quickly unties himself and flees. however, before he can escape, he is cornered and attacked by someone, or something. soon after, his body, along with the bodies of the other two policemen, are brought up and examined. the doctor announces that they, too, were killed by a sharp object that simply sliced them apart. later that night, the wife of one of the murdered men runs to kiyo's house and screams threats at her through the door, as she believes that her brother, goro, is the killer. shigeru soon arrives and comforts her, telling her that the officers that were killed were goro's friends, and that he had no reason to kill them. someone else, then, killed those men. as the two sit together, the answer to the question of who, or what, murdered the men suddenly reveals itself: a gigantic creature, resembling a gigantic insect larva, enters kiyo's home, and both kiyo and shigeru flee. the police enter the home, but the giant insect forces them to flee. when they regroup, they chase the creature to the top of a hill and open fire with machine guns. the monster launches its self down the hillside and grabs two officers, clutching them in its pincers as it flees. it soon drops them and quickly escapes back into the mine. when the police and shigeru reach the injured officers, they discover that their wounds match the wounds of the murdered policemen and yoshi. they have found the killer. soon after, shigeru and a group of the metro-police head back into the mine to confront the insect monster and attempt to locate goro, dead or alive. unfortunately, as they enter the deepest part of the mine shaft, they discover the butchered body of goro laying on the floor of the mine. as they approach, the giant insect emerges and chases the men back up the mine shaft. taking action, shigeru releases the mine cart, which rolls down the shaft and collides with the insect, crushing and killing it. shigeru and the others then venture back into the shaft and remove goro's body. they discover a large hole in the wall that opens up into a large cave. they realize that this is the hole through which the water and the giant insect emerged. as they peek through, they are noticed by not just one, but several more giant insects. however, before the monsters can attack, the ground begins to shake, and the mine begins to cave in. shigeru is trapped in the cave, and the police can do nothing and the mine collapses. the next day, the police investigate the recent happenings. dr. kashiwagi identifies the giant insect as a meganulon, an ancient species of dragonfly larvae that had lived on the earth millions of years earlier. as the doctor reveals his findings, an earthquake suddenly strikes the area. rumors begin to circulate that mt. aso, the volcano that eclipses kitamatsu, might be on the verge of an eruption. when the police arrive at the base of the volcano to investigate the damage caused by the earthquake, they are shocked to discover a man wandering around the epicenter. when they reach him, they discover that it is shigeru. however, he has received a blow to the head and has lost his memory. he is even unable to recognize kiyo. the doctors are not optimistic about his chances for recovery, but nevertheless do their best to try to help him any way that they can. several miles away, in kyushu, an air base receives an alert from one of their jets. the pilot has observed an unidentified flying object performing impossible maneuvers at supersonic speeds. he is ordered to pursue the object at distance, but as he follows it, the object suddenly changes course and turns around. the object then flies straight towards the jet and destroys it. soon after, reports from all over the world come in about the ufo. the strange object is observed flying over china, philippines and japan, and rumors of a secret military weapon test begin to circulate. back in japan, a newly married couple disappear, as well as several heads of cattle around mt. aso. when the authorities develop the film from the newlyweds' camera, they discover a photograph of what appears to be a gigantic wing. they match the photo with a drawing of a pteranodon, an ancient reptile thought to be extinct millions of years earlier. although the evidence seems to point to the pteranodon as the culprit, the theory is dismissed as being too far fetched. meanwhile, shigeru's treatment is progressing slowly, but no one, especially not kiyo, is giving up. one day, as shigeru sits silently in his hospital room, kiyo shows him the eggs that her pet birds have lain. as one of the eggs hatches, a terrible memory returns to shigeru: deep within the mine, shigeru awoke after the cave in. suddenly, he realized to his horror that he was surrounded by hundreds of meganulon. the creatures crawled all around the cave, having survived millions of years underground. shigeru then looked up and was shocked to see what appeared to be a giant egg sitting right in the middle of the cave. suddenly, the egg began to stir, and then, all of a sudden, it hatched. from out of the fractured shell emerged a gigantic, winged creature with a sharp beak and a head like a bird of prey. shigeru watched in horror as the enormous hatchling bent over and began to eat the meganulon. the monstrous insects that had terrorized the town and had killed his friends were now nothing more than a snack to this new creature. with all of the meganulon gone, the giant monster spread its wings and roared... shigeru suddenly awakens, his memory restored. as he recovers from seeing the horrifying vision, kiyo weeps with joy. shigeru confirms that the creature he saw did indeed resemble a pteranodon, and that it had eaten all of the meganulon. he and a group of police and scientists once again descend into the mine and enter the cave where the egg had been. they are able to recover a fragment of the shell before a rock slide forces them to flee back to the surface. in the lab, dr. kashiwagi is able to determine the size of the egg and its age: 200 million years old. after amassing the evidence, kashiwagi calls a meeting with members of the town, along with members of the japanese self-defence force to communicate his findings. he tells the men that the ufo seen flying all across the world at supersonic speeds is a gigantic pteranodon he has dubbed rodan. the 50 meter tall monster is capable of flying at extremely fast speeds, which create a sonic boom that more than likely led to the destruction of the jet that had first observed rodan. kashiwagi still has no explanation as to how the creature could have transversed the globe so quickly, and why reports of sightings occurred in multiple, distant countries at the same time. as to how rodan could have resurfaced after millions of years is also a mystery, but kashiwagi theorizes that nuclear bomb testing, which loosened the earth and opened cavities to long buried crevices and caves, might be the culprit. however, kashiwagi admits that this is only a guess. soon after, rodan emerges from the ground near mt. aso, near where the beast had hatched. the creature takes flight and begins to head for kyushu, with a squadron of the jasdf hot on his tail. they pursue rodan over the city, and eventually succeed in forcing him into the river. the flying reptile soon emerges, but his flight speed has been cut by half. rodan flies over the buildings at fukuoka, and the sonic wave created in its wake literally tears the structures apart. the flying monster lands in the city and flaps its wings, and the entire city is literally pulled down by its own weight. fires spread, and the jsdf attempt in vain to fight the creature off. the men, and the machines, are simply blown away. just when it seems things can't get worse, the jsdf reports that another rodan has been spotted heading towards the city. with the mystery of the spread out sightings now revealed, the second rodan now flies over and rips apart the buildings. after leveling the city and leaving the remaining buildings in flames, the monsters rodan fly away, leaving thousands dead. the jsdf formulate a plan to attack the rodans. after ascertaining their location at their old nest at the base of mt. aso, the military plan to shell the volcano and trigger an eruption that will trap the monsters under the lava and rock. however, kitamatsu will be completely destroyed in the attack, and the town is forced to evacuate. the army prepares for the attack. just moments before the strike is to begin, shigeru looks out the window to see kiyo climbing up the hill. he runs out to meet her, and she tells him that she has come to be with him. rather than evacuate, she has risked her life to face the danger with the man she loves. the two leave the area and return to safety, and the military begins its attack. they launch rockets and torpedoes at the mountain, and soon the volcano begins to spew smoke and lava into the sky. one of the rodans emerges, but is soon overcome by the fumes. as the second rodan arrives on the scene, the first loses altitude and finally falls into the stream of lava flowing down the side of the volcano. the ancient reptile begins to scream in pain as it burns alive in the lava. the military, dr. kashiwagi, shigeru and kiyo watch from a safe distance as the still flying rodan watches its companion die in agony. suddenly, the second rodan descends and lands with the first in the lava, and it too begins to burn. rather then live on alone, the creature will die with its companion. whether they be siblings or mates, the two rodans lie dying together in the flowing lava. kiyo buries her head in shigeru's shoulder and weeps, and both kashiwagi and shigeru watch solemnly as the two monsters, each unwilling to live without the other, die together on the slopes of the erupting volcano.\n","\n","    ### response:  rodan\n","\n","Actual title 2046\n","Mistral based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate

losing su li-zhen. the first concerns chow and wang jing wen, the second is about chow and bai ling, and the third is about chow and a different woman who is also named su li-zhen. the fourth takes place in chow's mysterious world of 2046 and concerns a japanese passenger falling in love with an android. typical of wong kar-wai films, the arcs are presented in pieces and in non-chronological order. the approximate order of the arcs is listed below. 2047 arc part i this section is the only part narrated by chow's fictional character and not chow himself. set in the far future, a huge rail network connects the planet. the world is a vast dystopia, and lonely souls all try to reach a mysterious place called 2046 in order to recapture lost loves. in the world of 2046 nothing ever changes, so there is never loss or sadness. no one has ever returned from 2046 except the protagonist, a lonely japanese man named tak . as the story begins, tak is on a long train ride returning from 2046. \"all memories are traces of tears\" as chow mo-wan's life is revisited, we learn that he is still struggling to get over the loss of his idealised love, su li-zhen. he returns to hong kong after being in singapore for a number of years to try to forget his anguish. to cover up his pain, he becomes a suave ladies' man. chow attends many lavish parties and beds many women. on christmas eve, chow meets lulu from the first film  whom he remembers from singapore, although she has no recollection of him. that night, chow mo-wan takes lulu home as she is quite drunk, but accidentally keeps her room key. as he leaves, he notices that her room number is 2046, the same room number that he and su li zhen had when they conducted their private affair. upon returning a few days later to return the room key, the landlord informs chow that the room is not available due to renovations. the landlord offers him the adjacent room 2047. chow later learns that lulu was stabbed in the room the night before by a jealous boyfriend. chow agrees to rent room 2047 in the meantime. after the renovation of room 2046 is complete, the landlord asks chow if he wants to move in. however, by this time he has gotten used to room 2047 and decides to stay there. the rooms 2046 and 2047 are connected by a common hallway, chow regularly watches and gets involved with the people that move into 2046. wang jing wen and wang jie wen arc part i the first person that moves next door into 2046 is the landlord's daughter, wang jing wen . chow spends a good deal of time just observing her from his room. he learns that she has a japanese boyfriend working in hong kong. unfortunately, the relationship is forbidden by her father. eventually, wang breaks up with her boyfriend, then suffers a breakdown and is institutionalised. afterwards, the next tenant that moves into 2046 is the younger daughter of the landlord, wang jie wen. she is young, attractive, and flirtatious. she frequently tries to seduce him but he refuses each time. a short time later, chow runs into some financial difficulties, and stops going out. to make some extra money, he starts to write a science fiction series called 2046. the story is set in the distant future, about a group of heart sick individuals looking for love. the only place to find it is at a mysterious location called 2046. virtually all of the characters in 2046 are based on people that chow has met, such as su li-zhen, lulu, or wang jing wen. whether 2046 is a place, a room, or a state of mind is never explicitly defined. chow makes the story somewhat bizarre and erotic, and readers seem to take notice. bai ling arc part i the third person to move into room 2046 is the coquettish bai ling . she wears similar qipao dresses as the original su li-zhen but radiates a much more aggressive sensuality than her. while it is never explicitly stated in the film, it is implied that she is a nightclub girl who occasionally doubles as a high-class prostitute. however, she is intent on finding a long-term relationship. in one instance, when chow overhears her arguing with a man, bai tells the man that to continue seeing her, he must end his relationship with the other woman. chow again spends a lot of time observing her across the thin wall separating rooms 2046 and 2047. on the next christmas eve, bai runs into chow just after she is dumped by her boyfriend before they are to go to singapore. chow suggests that they go for dinner, to which she grudgingly accepts. during dinner, chow tells bai about his experiences in singapore. she is intrigued, and after dinner she agrees to try to form a platonic friendship with him by borrowing time from each other. their brief friendship does not last however, as they soon develop carnal lust for each other. not surprisingly, chow wants to keep the relationship strictly physical; he continues to pick up other prostitutes. to compromise, bai soon develops a compensation system where he pays her 10 hong kong dollars  each time he stays over. however, over time bai finds that she has feelings for chow, and she asks him to discontinue seeing other women. chow refuses and gives a counter offer, the option to be his customer for $10 each night. bai is crushed and breaks things off with chow. as a way of revenge, bai then descends into seeing men exclusively for money, frequently changing partners. a short while later, she moves out of room 2046. wang jing wen part ii after bai ling moves out, wang jin wen moves back into 2046 after returning from the mental hospital. she is a shell of a former self, and still very depressed over the loss of her japanese boyfriend. her ex writes numerous letters in an attempt to reconcile with her, but she refuses due to her father. wang passes the time by assisting her father at the hotel. she also starts to spend more and more time with chow helping him with his writing and editing. at this point, he is regularly publishing chapters of 2046. these scenes are very similar to those in in the mood for love when su li-zhen used to help chow with his writing in their hotel room. chow remarks that this period in his life is the happiest that he has been after su li-zhen. however, before he realises it, he develops feelings for wang jing wen. he makes some minor attempts to start a romance with her, but nothing develops since she is still very much in love with the japanese man. one day wang jin wen asks chow rhetorically if some things in life never change. he answers her by writing a story called 2047. in this story, a japanese man leaves the world of 2046, but falls in love on the journey home. while he initially tried to base the story on wang jing wen's ex-boyfriend, he realises that the story is ultimately about himself. 2047 arc part ii chow's fictional world is revisited. however, this time it is narrated by chow himself. set in the far future, for passengers to reach or leave 2046 they must take a long journey on a vast train network. the main character, tak  is trying to leave 2046 because he lost the love of his life in that world. as the train travels through the extremely cold sections 1224‚äì1225, tak becomes intimate with one of the train's female android assistants  and later falls in love with her. he then asks her numerous times to come with him. however, each time the android does not answer. tak has heard earlier that excessive operation causes the android's response time to slow down and decides to wait on the train to see if this is the case. he sits quietly on the train, and counts the seconds that go by, hoping the android will decide to leave with him. however, the android still does not respond. ultimately, tak realises that it is not a delayed reaction that causes that android not to respond, but that she is in love with someone else and that their relationship is simply not meant to be. with this knowledge, he finally has the strength to leave the train and 2046. completing the story marks a turning point in chow's recovery. wang jing wen part iii next christmas, chow invites wang jing wen out to dinner. after finding out that she still misses her ex in japan, he takes her to his office so that she can call him to wish him well. looking sadly through the window panes as wang jing wen is overjoyed talking to her ex, chow remarks that in fact section 1224-1225 from the story are simply the dates for christmas eve and christmas day when everyone is especially lonely and needs additional love. he goes on to say that while he had feelings for her, and most likely could have taken advantage of the situation  he was happy that in this situation he did the \"right thing\". the call re-ignites the romance. soon afterward, wang jing wen moves to japan and gets engaged. a short while later, while still feeling depressed over the loss of wang jing wen, chow runs into lulu again as she has a violent confrontation with another woman that is sleeping with her current playboy boyfriend. this incident is identical to one that occurred in the original days of being wild when she confronted the original su li-zhen for sleeping with yuddy. chow remarks that lulu, is likely to forever remain living in the past. however, he then remarks that this is not really a sad thing, as she seems perfectly content to be miserable. the incident strengthens chow's resolve to get over su li-zhen. bai ling arc part ii some time later, chow gets a call from bai ling and the two go out to dinner. this time, bai looks much less glamorous and more \"run-down\". she informs chow that she plans to leave for singapore, and asks him to provide a reference and plane fare. she also asks where he was last christmas, as she stopped by at that time, and was hoping to see him. in fact, she remarks that she really misses him. it turns out, during last christmas, chow had gone back to singapore in an attempt to find a former lover, another woman named su li-zhen . su li-zhen arc chronologically, this arc occurs first in the film. chow met the second su li-zhen some years back when he first arrived in singapore. at that time, he was still grieving over losing the original su li-zhen and spending much of his free time in the local casinos. after losing much of his savings, he encounters the second su li-zhen, a mysterious gambler. they become lovers, and he soon wants to know everything about her. but she insists that he beat her in a \"high-card\" draw before she will reveal anything about her past, which he never is able to do. eventually, she agrees to help him win back his money so that he can return to hong kong. when she does so, he prepares to leave, and asks her to go with him. again, she challenges him to a high-card draw, which he again loses. knowing little about her, chow speculates that she, like himself, has a troubled past. initially heartbroken about this, he remarks that after he completes the story '2047' he finally understands why the second su li-zhen did not go with him, as he would again have tried to recapture the past by looking for elements of the original su li-zhen. when chow went back to singapore to visit her the second time, he does not find her. he makes some inquiries as to her whereabouts and speculates that she either returned to cambodia or was killed. bai ling arc part iii shortly after the events of 'bai ling arc part ii' and the night before she boards a plane for singapore, chow again meets bai ling for dinner. bai remarks that, between their two meetings, one of her clients has given her a lot of money and she wants to pay chow back immediately. he refuses to take the money. bai insists on paying for dinner, and chow is stunned when she hands him a stack of money, each $10 bill representing one night they had spent together. bai tells chow to pay for dinner with this stack of bills, while unbeknownst to him, she sadly watches behind the restaurant's green window veils. after dinner, chow walks her back to her apartment. grasping his hands at the apartment door, she begs him to lend his time to her once more and spend the night. she then asks him \"why can't it be like it was before?\" he refuses to stay over, even out of pity, coldly stating that that is simply something he would never lend. he exits by jerking his hands away from her and remarks in voiceover that this was the last time he ever saw her. he leaves in a taxi, staring emptily into space, as the camera slowly enters a whispering hole.\n","\n","    ### response:

\"peter o'toole\", 'donald wolfit', 'martita hunt', 'pamela brown', 'john gielgud', 'richard burton', 'paolo stoppa', 'felix aylmer', 'gino cervi', 'david weston'], released in the year: 1964, summary of the movie plot: the film's action takes place during the late 12th century, about 100 years after the 1066 norman conquest of england. the conquest largely removed the native  ruling class, replacing it with a foreign, french-speaking monarchy, aristocracy, and clerical hierarchy. the story line monitors the transformation of thomas becket, portrayed, following the play, as a saxon prot√©g√© and facilitator to the carousing king henry, into a man who continually invokes the \"honor of god\". henry appoints becket as archbishop of canterbury in order to have a close confidant in this position that he could completely control. instead, becket becomes a major thorn in his side in a jurisdictional dispute. much of the plot concerns henry, the \"perennial adolescent\" as described by the bishop of london, who finds his duties as king and his stale arranged marriage to be oppressive. early in the film, we see him escaping them through drunken forays onto the hunting grounds and local brothels. he is increasingly dependent on becket, a saxon commoner, who arranges these debaucheries when he is not busy running henry's court. this foments great resentment on the part of henry's norman noblemen, who distrust and envy this saxon upstart, as well as the queen and queen mother, who see becket as an unnatural and unseemly influence upon the royal personage. henry finds himself in continuous conflict with the elderly archbishop of canterbury, who opposes the taxation of church property in order to support henry's military campaigns in france . during one of his campaigns in coastal france, he receives word that the old bishop has \"gone to god's bosom\". in a burst of inspiration, henry exercises his prerogative to pick the next archbishop and informs an astonished becket that he is the royal choice. shortly thereafter, becket sides with the church, throwing henry into a fury. one of the main bones of contention is thomas' excommunication of lord gilbert, one of henry's most loyal stalwarts, for seizing and ordering the killing of a priest who had been accused of sexual indiscretions with a young girl, before the priest can even be handed over for ecclesiastical trial. gilbert then refuses to acknowledge his transgressions and seek absolution. the king has a dramatic secret meeting with the bishop of london in his cathedral . he lays out his plan to remove the troublesome cleric through scandal and innuendo which the position-conscious bishop of london quickly agrees to . these attempts fall flat when becket, in full ecclesiastic garb, confronts his accusers outside the rectory and routs them causing henry to laugh and bitterly note the irony of it all, \"becket is the only intelligent man in my entire kingdom...and he is against me!\" becket escapes to france where he encounters the conniving yet sympathetic king louis . king louis sees in becket a means by which he can further his favorite pastime, tormenting the arrogant english. becket gets to rome, where he begs the holy pontiff to allow him to renounce his position and retire to a monastery as an ordinary priest. the vatican is a hotbed of intrigue and political jockeying. the pope reminds becket that he has an obligation as a matter of principle to return to england and take a stand against civil interference in church matters. becket yields to this decision and asks louis to arrange a meeting with henry on the beaches at normandy. henry asks becket whether or not he loved him and becket replied that he loved henry to the best of his ability. a shaky truce is declared and becket is allowed to return to england. the remainder of the film shows henry rapidly sinking into drunken fixation over becket and his perceived betrayal. the barons worsen his mood by pointing out that becket has become a folk hero among the vanquished saxons who are ever restive and resentful of their norman conquerors. there are comical fights between henry and his frumpy consort, eleanor of aquitaine, his dimwitted son/heir apparent, and his cold-blooded mother, who repeatedly reminds her son that his father would have quickly had someone like becket done away with for the sake of the realm. during one of his drunken rages he asks \"will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest?\" his faithful barons hear this and proceed quickly to canterbury, where they put thomas and his saxon deputy, brother john, to the sword. a badly shaken henry then undergoes a penance by whipping at the hands of saxon monks. the film concludes with henry, fresh from his whipping, publicly proclaiming thomas becket a saint and that the ones who had killed him will be justly punished.\n","\n","    ### response:  becket\n","\n","Actual title kung

to fight individually, rhino, ox and croc manage to combine their talents to defeat them in a coordinated attack. at the moment of their victory, master oogway reappears, having captured the rest of the gangs and praising his fellows for being worthy warriors who have found a higher purpose. the scene returns to the exhibit in the morning, where master po concludes the story of how the new masters formed the masters' council in gongmen city. unfortunately, master shifu  discovers them. while not being furious, he still sets po to work to repair the roof he damaged breaking in before the

warns him not to practice his skills there. farrell ignores his advice, cheats at blackjack, and is taken by two men to see the casino's owner, who turns out to be mundson. farrell talks mundson into hiring him and quickly gains his confidence. however, the unimpressed washroom attendant, uncle pio , keeps calling him \"peasant\". one day, mundson returns from a trip with a beautiful and spirited new wife, gilda . it is immediately apparent that johnny and gilda have a history together, though both deny it when mundson questions them. johnny visits gilda alone in the bedroom she shares with her husband, and the two have an explosive confrontation that elucidates both their past romantic relationship, which ended badly, and their love-hate dynamic. while it is unclear just how much mundson knows of gilda and johnny's past relationship, he appears to be in ignorance when he assigns farrell to keep an eye on gilda. johnny and gilda are both consumed with their hatred of each other, as gilda cavorts with men at all hours in increasingly more blatant efforts to enrage johnny, and he grows more abusive and spiteful in his treatment of her. meanwhile, mundson is visited by two german businessmen. their secret organization had financed a tungsten cartel, with everything put in mundson's name to hide their connection to it. however, when they decide it is safe to take over, mundson refuses to transfer ownership to his backers. the argentine secret police are interested in the germans; government agent obregon  introduces himself to farrell to try to obtain information, but the american knows nothing about that aspect of mundson's operations. when the germans return later, mundson shoots and kills one of them. that same night, at mundson's house, farrell and gilda have another hostile confrontation, which begins with them angrily declaring their hate for each other, and ends with them passionately kissing. mundson arrives at that moment, then flees to a waiting airplane. farrell and obregon witness its short flight; the plane explodes shortly after takeoff and plummets into the ocean. however, mundson has parachuted to safety, thus faking his death. with mundson apparently dead, gilda inherits his estate. gilda and johnny marry, but while gilda married him for love, johnny has married her to punish them both for their mutual betrayal of mundson. he stays away, but has her guarded day and night out of contempt for her and loyalty to mundson. gilda tries to escape the tortured marriage a number of times , but johnny is ultimately able to thwart every attempt, determined to keep her trapped in the relationship that has become a prison for them both. finally, obregon tells farrell that gilda was never truly unfaithful to mundson or to him, prompting farrell to try to reconcile with her. at that moment, mundson reappears, armed with a gun. he faked his death to deceive the nazis. mundson tells them he will have to kill them both, but uncle pio manages to fatally stab him in the back. obregon shows up, and johnny tries to take the blame for the murder. uncle pio finally credits johnny for being a true gentleman, while insisting that he had killed mundson. obregon reminds them both that mundson had technically died years before, but there is also such a thing as justifiable homicide. farrell gives obregon the incriminating documents from mundson's safe, and the police confiscate the estate for the government. farrell and gilda finally reconcile and confess their mutual love, and apologize for the many emotional wounds

The king freaks out and chases the boy throughout the castle, but he didn’t see the boy’s face so he doesn’t know exactly who it is. He chases him back to the servant quarters which are like, a bunch of cots in a row with a ton of other servants sleeping in them. The servant boy lays down in his cot and pretends to be asleep, and the king comes down and starts to lean down and listen to all the servant’s hearts while they’re sleeping to see who’s heart is beating the fastest from running to find out which boy was kissing his daughter.

The only part I saw of this movie was that there were two little boys and a woman. I think the boys were brothers and one was a few years older than the other. The younger one was probably 4 or 5 maybe. The boys tied up the woman to a chair. I don't believe this woman was their mom, but maybe it could be a gf of their dad or maybe their stepmom? That detail I'm not sure about, but the way they were treating her made it seem that way. The older boy was being mean to the woman but the younger boy was trying to get the woman a glass of water or something. On the way over to the woman, the youngest boy falls down and lands on the drinking glass, breaking it into pieces. The pieces of glass go into the boys chest or abdomen. The woman then starts begging the older boy to let her go so that she could take his brother to the hospital.

The police officer investigating it talks to the husband, and implies that he suspects the woman is faking it. The husband is talking to a friend about it, and says he didn't like the police officer's implication, but then says he supposes it's his job to look at it from all angles. Later, the woman says the man is calling her, and everyone including the husband thinks she's hallucinating it, I think it's because the phone was disconnected or something like that, and she's sent to a psychiatric hospital.

She says that in the movie a young boy moved to a building where a girl had died after falling from the top of the stairs in the building. He decided to investigate her death and found out that what really happened was that she had jumped from the top so that her mother/nanny could catch her, but missed and she died. My friend also adds that the boy moved to the building to be with his uncle, who had a room full of taxidermy animals and the boy could not come inside. The animal's eyes were really diamonds, and those where important in the plot for solving some mystery or something.    I can't remember if she mentioned anything else, but these were the main points. She is not sure if the movie is Spanish (we are from Spain) or not, so maybe it was not really popular in other countries.    Maybe this description is not of one movie but two or more!

I liked the movie enough to want to remember it and wrote it down, sadly that paper was lost years ago.    Anyways, I believe it to be British made film in where a man dealing with trauma has created inside himself the idea and narrative he is a superhero (who is actually currently in cell block CTscan if ya catch my drift), with this belief we see the man overlay his idea of how just he is being in his actions by being given the vivid imagery of a dystopian cityscape and him believing to be the antihero everyone is beckoning for. Multiple scenes of what seem a muted color and cool action stealth transpire. He has a nemesis throughout these “visions” however it is not immediately anthropomorphized in the storyline or plot. Alongside this bag of marbles doing his thing, people are living separately from his plot line, however, showing their struggles and problems. (More) normal people continue to thread together until the ending, where the escapee (superhero) tries to kill his father (nemesis) from a rooftop overlooking a restaurant where his father and said normies are dining.

They find a drunk Caroline on stage at a gay cabaret dressed as a Christmas tree. When they arrive at Nick's car, Tris is sitting on the hood waiting for him. Before Nick leaves to go to talk to her, Norah tells him how nice it was to meet him, but he leaves without a response.

Nick, meanwhile, decides to confront Tris, but she tells him she wants to be together again and asks for a ride home. Tris asks Nick to stop by the river, where she tries to seduce him. Whilst she seductively dances in front of the car, Nick reminisces fondly about Norah and the night's events and drives away, leaving Tris behind.

Michiel feels resentment towards his father, the mayor, who is seemingly only interested in maintaining the status quo between the town and the German Army. He worships his Uncle Ben, an adventurer in contact with the local resistance. During the winter, Michiel's loyalties are tested. An allied plane is hit in the air and crashes, but before it hits the ground, a young British airman is able to escape by parachute. One of the villagers, Dirk, helps the airman, Jack, but Dirk is arrested. Before his arrest, Dirk gives Michiel a letter to be delivered to Bertus, the village blacksmith. Before Michiel can deliver the letter, Bertus is shot and killed by the Germans. Michiel opens the letter, which directs him to Jack's hiding place in the forest. Jack is injured, and Michiel enlists the aid of his sister Erica, a nurse, to take care of him. Jack and Erica soon develop a romantic relationship. Michiel's father is arrested when the body of a German soldier, killed by Jack on the night of the plane crash, is found in the forest. Jack wants to turn himself in to save Michiel's father, but Ben tells Michiel he can save his father. Ben's efforts fail, and Michiel's father is shot by the Germans. Michiel ties to take Jack to the town of Zwolle, across a river, but the Germans foil their attempt, and the two narrowly escape after a chase through the forest. Michiel finally turns to his Uncle Ben for help in getting Jack to Zwolle. Ben agrees, and Ben, Jack and Erica set off for the bridge to Zwolle. As they leave, Ben tells Michiel that Dirk should never have gotten Michiel involved with Jack. After they go, Michiel realizes that he had never mentioned Dirk's role to Ben. Quickly checking Ben's suitcase, he finds papers showing that Ben is working for the Germans. Rushing to the river, Michiel stops the trio, grabs Jack's pistol, and confronts Ben. While Michiel guards Ben, Jack and Erica succeed in making it across the river to Zwolle. Ben tells Michiel that he had arranged for his father to be released, but that his father refused to let another villager be shot in his place. Ben attempts to escape to a passing German patrol, but Michiel shoots and kills him. A few months later, Allied soldiers enter the village and are rapturously welcomed by the villagers. One of the soldiers brings a letter for Erica, presumably from Jack. Michiel hesitates to join in the celebrations after all that has happened, but finally joins in.\n","\n","    ### Response: 45 Years of Living Dangerously\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

Whether it is communal bias, social bias, economic bias, religious bias or educational bias, the \"bias\" factor dominates the entire depiction of the film, merging different characters into one story. The different biases that are incorporated into the film are as following: #Religious bias - A devout Muslim listens to the radical sermons of a religious leader that aims to instigate his followers to take revenge for the wrongdoings occurring within the Islamic community. This leads his followers to collaborate to create havoc in the city, but plans fail. However, when the plan is about to succeed, the follower decides to abort it, seeing a Hindu boy walk towards it. This child had previously helped a lost Muslim girl find her mother. #Communal bias - Rajpal Yadav is a Bihari who has just arrived in Mumbai, looking for work. In his quest for some money and food, Yadav encounters incredible bias against his community, with Marathis blaming his creed for taking away jobs and others ridiculing his sub-par technical skills. On the other side, a Brahmin politician opposes his son's courtship of a Dalit girl; however, he decides to exploit the relationship for political gain. #Social bias - Sarika is the administrator of a large hospital, running it with zeal and fervor. Seema Biswas is a poor woman who is trying to gather funds for her husband's bail money, as he has been framed in a fraudulent case. Biswas works at Sarika's house, cooking meals and cleaning the house. Despite Seema's honest work, Sarika continues to doubt her when things go missing, checking her purse and doubting her character. In the end, it is Biswas who comes to the aid of Sarika at a crucial moment. #Gender bias - Sarika's husband is a successful builder and owner of several Call Centre across Mumbai. Intoxicated with money and power, he finds himself unable to resist deflowering women, using every moment to lure women, by showering expensive gifts on them. However, a moment arrives where he finds himself on crossroads, unable to face the reality, but understanding its repercussions. #Economic bias - Perizaad Zorabian is a successful creative head of a channel. However, work and life has tensed her. She is unable to bear the hectic pressure of Mumbai and asks her husband to find work in either the United States or United Kingdom. Perizaad looks for opportunities to insult people and finds her financial power too strong to succumb to emotion. Biases of these sort weave the entire story into finding resolutions based on the biases of individuals and the reality of the lifestyle of Mumbai. The message clearly floated through movie is We have to learn to live together like Brothers or perish like Fools, as said by M. Luther King. This movie plot has certain similarities with the plot of Crash , an American movie starring Matt Dillon, Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Thandie Newton and Brendan Fraser.{{cite news}}\n","\n","    ### Response: 100% Indian\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

As the Sultan leaves, the trail of a burrowing rabbit crosses the desert towards the cave. Hassan spots the burrow tunneling under the entrance of the cave and attempts to chase out the intruders, but has trouble remembering the command to open the door. Inside the cave, Bugs Bunny and his traveling companion Daffy Duck emerge from the burrow, believing they have arrived at Pismo Beach. Daffy's complaints are silenced when he spots the riches. Determined to keep it all for himself he stomps repeatedly on Bugs to force him back into the burrow. Meanwhile Hassan finally says the correct command to open the door and marches in. He is met by Daffy, who is wheeling a cart full of loot. Daffy asks him to call a cab. In response, Hassan brings his sword down on Daffy's head, splitting in half both the diamond-adorned hat he is wearing and a single feather underneath. Daffy flees in terror and uses a large gem to try bribing Bugs into saving him, but Bugs is only concerned with dusting himself off from the earlier abuse from Daffy. Hassan rushes towards them both, sword raised. Daffy hides and tells Hassan to chop the rabbit, but Bugs has disguised himself to be a genie in a bottle and fools Hassan with a rich offer for releasing him. Hassan does, taking no notice of Daffy's attempt to expose Bugs. Bugs tells Hassan the treasure is his to claim. Daffy sardonically mocks Bugs for allowing Hassan access to the treasure he wanted for himself. Outside the cave, Bugs surveys the desert and concludes he is in the wrong place. Suddenly Daffy runs out carrying a large gem, with the enraged Hassan in hot pursuit. Daffy begs Bugs to save him, and this time Bugs reluctantly complies while berating Daffy for his greed. He sets up an Indian rope trick behind a rock, and misleads Hassan up the rope. As Hassan disappears into the clouds, Bugs pulls the rope down. With the coast clear, Daffy runs back to the cave to claim the treasure. Some time later, Daffy has emptied the cave of treasure into an enormous cart. Looking back, he spots an old oil lamp and rubs the dust off it. A genie emerges from the lamp, but Daffy thinks the genie is after the treasure and proceeds to stomp him back into the lamp. The furious genie erupts from the lamp, declaring Daffy will suffer the 'consequences' and Bugs, unable  to save Daffy now, hurriedly escapes via burrow. Daffy dismisses his punishment as he's still rich. Much later, Bugs has finally made it to Pismo Beach and, while tucking into the area's famous clams, casually wonders how Daffy's encounter with the genie worked out. Opening one clam and discovering a pearl inside, he soon finds out; Daffy, shrunk to a few inches in height, emerges from Bugs' burrow trail in the sand and claims the pearl for his own. Bugs closes the clam on the greedy duck.\n","\n","    ### Response: 4 Hare Force\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

Chronologically, the order would be: *The Second Renaissance - a prequel set generations before the original film, The Matrix, relating how humans built artificially intelligent Machines, the apocalyptic war between the two, ending with the Machines enslaving the human race and the initial creation of The Matrix virtual reality. *A Detective Story - a stand-alone story in which the character Trinity appears, but independently of any other characters. Because Trinity is present it takes place at least within several years of the films, and though it is not made clear within the cartoon if it takes place before or after Trinity met Neo in the original film, another official source places it before the events of The Matrix.Matrix Universe poster, included in Enter the Matrix: Official Strategy Guide, Bradygames, 2003. *Kid's Story - set during the six month gap between the events of the first and second films, after Neo joins the crew of the Nebuchadnezzar in freeing other humans from the Matrix. Its events are briefly alluded to in dialogue at the beginning of The Matrix Reloaded. *Final Flight of the Osiris - takes place directly before The Matrix Reloaded, as the hovercraft Osiris stumbles upon the Sentinel army digging to Zion. At the beginning of The Matrix Reloaded, Niobe mentions that their reconnaissance photos of the Machine army were transmitted from the Osiris. The other four shorts  are independent of the events of any other installment. While they generically deal with the virtual reality of the Matrix, and the Zion rebels, conceivably they could take place at any point in the generations-long struggle between the human rebels and the Machines running the Matrix. Like the Matrix trilogy, the entire movie except The Final Flight of the Osiris was rated R by the MPAA mainly for its Sci-Fi violence. When it was released on DVD, it was unrated.  The Second Renaissance is a two-part film written and directed by Mahiro Maeda. He used Bits and Pieces of Information written by the The Wachowskis as a prequel to the series as a base for the first part. With increasing numbers of people released from all labor, the human population has become lazy, arrogant, and corrupt. Despite this, the machines were content with serving humanity and, as the narrator states, \"for a time, it [the status quo] was good\". This phrase is a reference to one of the most famous phrases of Genesis, consistent with the Biblical references seen throughout the original Matrix films, and is one of numerous references to Genesis in particular present in \"Second Renaissance\". The relationship between humans and machines changes in the year 2090, when a domestic android is threatened by its owner. The android, named B1-66ER in what appears to be a reference to the character Bigger Thomas from the novel Native Son, then kills the owner, his pets, and a mechanic instructed to deactivate the robot. This murder is the first incident of an artificially intelligent machine killing a human. B1-66ER is arrested and put on trial, but justifies the crime as self-defense, stating that it \"simply did not want to die\". During the trial scene, there is a voice-over of Clarence Darrow  quoting a famous line from the Dred Scott v. Sandford case in 1856 in his closing statement, which implicitly ruled that African Americans were not entitled to citizenship under United States law. Using this as a precedent, the prosecution argues that machines are not entitled to the same rights as human beings, and specifically that human beings have a right to destroy their property, while the defense urges the listener not to repeat history, and to judge B1-66ER as a human and not a machine . {{quote}} B1-66ER loses the court case and is destroyed. Across the industrialized world, mass civil disturbances erupt when robots and their human sympathizers rise in protest. World leaders fear a robot rebellion, and governments across the planet initiate a major program to destroy all humanoid machines. News reports show rioting in American and Western European cities such as Chicago and Berlin, alongside the peaceful \"Million Machine March\" on the Albany district courthouse where B1-66ER was sentenced. Visual references are made to such incidents as General Nguy·ªÖn Ng·ªçc Loan's execution of Viet Cong officer Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn L√©m, the Tank Man standoff following the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, the Al-Aqsa Intifada and The Holocaust. Some robots escape destruction when humans, in their greed, still want the robots to work and produce things for them. The machine population is exiled, and they create their own nation in the Middle East, named Zero One . According to the narrator, the robots built Zero One in \"the cradle of human civilization\", an allusion to the Fertile Crescent, apparently located in Saudi Arabia's \"Empty Quarter\" which is devoid of human life. Essentially ghettoized at Zero One, the machines establish their own industrial base there and begin to produce efficient, highly advanced artificial intelligence, echoing Vernor Vinge's thoughts on a technological singularity. The new nation excels at manufacturing high-tech consumer products, and before long, Zero One's consistent export of cheap, reliable, mass-produced goods begin to undercut the global economy. The United Nations Security Council calls an emergency economic summit at UN headquarters in New York City, resulting in UN delegates approving of a global economic blockade of Zero One that echoes the Cuban Missile Crisis. Two robotic ambassadors, built as a mechanical Adam and Eve, are sent by the leaders of Zero One to peacefully request the admission of their state to the United Nations as a prelude to settling the economic crisis peacefully. Despite their peaceful intentions, the ambassadors are forcibly removed from the chamber, and their application is rejected. As this scene unfolds, the narrator states that \"this was not the last time the machines would take the floor there\" foreshadowing the end of Part II. Part I ends as the Security Council debates the issue of short-sightedly declaring war on the Machine Empire.  Part II opens with United Nations aircraft unleashing a massive nuclear bombardment on Zero One. The nuclear carpet bombing devastates the machine city, but is unsuccessful in destroying many elements of the mechanical population, given that the machines did not have the same weaknesses to the bombs' fallout and heat as humans. The machines retaliate by unleashing their armies to conquer neighboring human countries, triggering a world war between the United Nations and Zero One. Unfortunately, most of the world's industrial output is already based in Zero One, as the lazy humans had grown accustomed to not producing things for themselves. Despite their best efforts, human troops are unable to hold back Zero One's relentlessly efficient onslaught, and slowly retreat . As the machine forces push deeper across the planet, military leaders begin to pursue increasingly desperate solutions. At a summit of political and military leaders from around the world, unanimous approval is given to a plan code-named \"Operation Dark Storm\", which aims to cut the machines off from the sun, their primary energy source. The plan is executed in 2095, with high altitude bombers dispersing sky-darkening nanomachines into the air, while the human armies simultaneously launch a ground offensive against the machine forces. The plan is initially successful, although many of the human nations' long-range weapons systems are also disabled by the lack of sunlight. With their high-tech weapons rendered useless, human commanders are forced to launch close-quarters infantry engagements, supported by electromagnetic artillery fire and armored assaults using atomic tanks and powered armor. Heavy losses are taken on both sides, but the Machines gradually gain the upper hand. Legions of a new model of machine, no longer in humanoid form and appearing more like the insectoid or cephalopod-like Sentinels and others of the Matrix films, overrun the human armies. This coincides with the destruction of original man-made robots at the hands of human forces and, as a result, the further dehumanization of the rapidly emerging machine collective. As the machine armies swarm across the human defenses, the United Nations, in desperation, fires nuclear missiles directly at the machine armies, vaporizing their own troops in the process. To make up for the lack of solar power, the machines begin capturing human prisoners and using their bodies to power large biomechanical tanks, which quickly cut through the dwindling human artillery. As the expanding armies of Zero One overrun Eurasia, they unleash lethal biological weapons which further ravage humanity. Eventually brought to its knees by the might of the machine army, the Security Council calls a global summit at U.N. headquarters to sign an armistice and end the war. Zero One's machine ambassador signs the peace treaty with a barcode, in which the humans agree to surrender their remaining territories to the machines. \"Your flesh is a relic, a mere vessel. Hand over your flesh and a new world awaits you. We demand it\" are the only words the machine utters before it detonates a nuclear bomb in the meeting chamber, killing most of the planet's leaders and destroying New York City, one of the few remaining human settlements. In 2102, the machines crush the leaderless remnants of the human armies, and the war ends. Zero One is victorious, but it is a Pyrrhic victory: the planet has been devastated by the war and by the crippling ecological impact of the Dark Storm shroud, which the machines are unable to remove. In need of a new energy source, the machines adapt their bioelectric tank technology to build vast human-stocked power stations, using their bodies' waste-energy to catalyze a powerful fusion reaction, in which in its making the Humans endure many days of agonising torture, and at its completion, the Machines create the computer-generated virtual reality of the Matrix , to keep their prisoners sedated by feeding the virtual world into the prisoners' brains, starting with the first prototype Matrix .  Kid's Story was written by the The Wachowskis and directed by Shinichiro Watanabe, with animations by Kazuto Nakazawa and production design by Studio 4¬∞C, Tokyo. It is the only one of the animated shorts contained in The Animatrix in which Neo appears. The short takes place during the six month gap between The Matrix and The Matrix: Reloaded, during which time Neo has joined the crew of the Nebuchadnezzar and is helping the rebels to free other humans from the Matrix. Kid  is a disaffected teenager who feels there is something wrong with the world, frequenting hacker chatrooms on the internet and wondering if he is alone. In school, he absent-mindendly scribbles \"Neo lives\" in his notebook. One day he receives a personal invitation from Neo  to escape the Matrix . The following day, he receives a call from Neo on his cell phone, and is chased through his high school by a band of Agents, before ultimately being cornered on the roof. He asserts his faith in Neo, and throws himself from the roof, whereupon the other characters are shown holding his funeral. The short fades up from black as the Kid awakens in the real world to see Neo and Trinity watching over him. They remark that he has achieved \"self substantiation\" , which was considered impossible. In both the short itself and The Matrix Reloaded, however, the Kid seems to believe it was Neo's actions, not his own, that saved him. Self-substantiation is never thoroughly discussed in any part of the series. Morpheus speaks of the founder of Zion who freed himself, presumably without external help. However, this was revealed to be a ruse by the machines. Kid's Story and World Record both heavily hint at this as the viewer wonders how a man being awoken from one of those pods, apparently helpless, could somehow build and start a city.  Program was written and directed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri. The character designs were done by Yutaka Minowa. In case with Beyond and Matriculated it is also a midquel of the first or second film. It follows the protagonist, \"Cis\" , who is engaged in her \"favorite simulation\": a battle program set in feudal Japan. After successfully eliminating an attacking enemy cavalry, a lone samurai appears whom Cis recognizes as \"Duo\" . \"Cis\" made her first appearance as an image in The Matrix Revisited. Initially, the two duel as allies, testing one another's fighting abilities. During the course of their duel, Duo briefly disarms Cis. He questions her concentration and wonders whether she regrets taking the Red Pill that took them out of the \"peaceful life of the virtual world\". They continue fighting until she finally overpowers Duo and is poised for the 'kill'. It is at this point that Duo states that he has \"something to say\". She sarcastically assumes that he wants to propose [marriage]; but instead he admits a desire to return to the Matrix; incredulous, Cis nevertheless responds that doing so is impossible as 'the truth' is already known to them, forbidding their re-integration. Duo reasons that reality is harsh and that he is tired of it. He adds that the Machines can make the both of them forget the truth. Duo then states that he has disabled or killed the other crewmembers and contacted the Machines. He asks Cis to return with him to the Matrix, but she continues to refuse. As Duo becomes more aggressive in his arguments for returning, Cis attempts to escape while simultaneously warding off his attacks. Becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the situation, Cis requests an operator in order to exit the simulation. Duo tells her that no one can hear her and reiterates that it \"is already done...[the machines] are on their way\". Thereafter their fighting becomes much more serious and forceful as they move from rooftop to rooftop. Duo, in a flying leap, attacks her from above with his sword. As the blade comes towards her, Cis, standing her ground, concentrates and halts its forward motion inches from her face and breaks it. She takes the broken end of the blade and thrusts it into Duo. Duo states his love for her as he dies. Suddenly, she wakes from the program and discovers that the encounter with Duo was a test program devised for training purposes. A man named \"Kaiser\"  unsuccessfully assures her that she acted appropriately during the test and met the test's targets. Clearly upset, she punches him in the face and walks away. He remarks that \"aside from that last part\", she passed the test.  World Record was created by Madhouse and directed by Takeshi Koike, with a screenplay by Yoshiaki Kawajiri and is also a midquel of the first or second film. The beginning of this short includes a short narration from the Instructor  explaining details behind the discovery of the Matrix by \"plugged-in\" humans. Only exceptional humans tend to become aware of the Matrix, who have \"a rare degree of intuition, sensitivity, and a questioning nature\", all qualities which are used to identify inconsistencies in the Matrix. This is not without exceptions, given that \"Some attain this wisdom through wholly different means.\" The story is about Dan Davis, a track athlete, who's competing in the 100m in the Summer Olympic Games. He has set a world record time of 8.99 seconds, but his subsequent gold medal was revoked for drug use. He decides to compete again and break his own record to \"prove them wrong.\" Despite support from his father and a young reporter, Dan's trainer tells him that he is physically unfit to race and that pushing himself too hard will cause a career ending injury. Dan is adamant on racing. On the day of the race, he is monitored by 4 agents located in the stadium. The race begins and Dan starts off strong. However, the muscles in his leg violently rupture, putting him at a setback and scaring many of the people in the stands. Through strong willpower, Dan ignores the injury and runs much faster than he did before, easily passing the other athletes. Before he can cross the finish line, 3 of the agents possess the 3 closest runners and try and stop him, but even they can't catch up to him. Dan's massive burst of energy in the Matrix causes his real-world counterpart  to rip apart the plug connecting him to the Matrix, causing him to see the real world through his pod. A Sentinel restrains him back in his pod and violently shocks him with electrified restraints. Dan's mind is thrown back into the Matrix, but his body is exhausted from the race and what he has just seen, causing him to tumble to the ground at high speeds. Despite this, Dan easily won the race and broke his original time of 8.99 seconds with a time of 8.72 seconds. The next scene shows a crippled Dan being wheeled by a nurse through a hospital. A nearby agent calls his other agents to tell them that they erased Dan's memory of the race and that he will never walk again; he won't be an issue. However, Dan quietly whispers the word, \"Free,\" angering the agent and telling him to sit back down. Davis then breaks free of the restraints in his wheelchair and takes a few steps before falling down again and being helped up by the nurse.  Beyond is written and directed by Koji Morimoto. It is a midquel short film, during the first or second installment of the trilogy. It follows a teenage girl, Yoko , looking for her cat Yuki. While asking around the neighborhood, indicatively somewhere in Japan, she meets some younger boys. One of them tells her Yuki is inside a \"haunted house\" and invites her to see it. The children have stumbled across an amalgamation of anomalies within an old, dilapidated building. They have learned to exploit this glitch in the Matrix for their own enjoyment, through several areas which seem to defy real-world physics: glass bottles reassemble after being shattered, rain falls from a sunny sky, broken lightbulbs flicker briefly , a door which opens into an endless dark void, shadows which do not align with their physical origins, and a dove's feather that rotates rapidly in place in mid-air. There is a large open space in the middle of the run-down building where they take turns jumping off a high point and falling towards the ground, yet somehow stopping inches before impact. This proves amusing and they do not seem to be bothered by the inherent strangeness of the place. Throughout the film, brief sequences show that Agents are aware of the problem in the Matrix, and a truck is seen driving toward the site to presumably deal with the problem. It arrives while the children are still playing, and an Agent-led team of \"rodent exterminators\" moves in to clear everybody out of it. The story ends when Yoko and the others return to the area the next day and find the site has been turned into an unremarkable parking lot. They unsuccessfully attempt to re-create the bizarre occurrences of yesterday and soon go in search of something else to do.  A Detective Story is written and directed by Shinichiro Watanabe, with animation by Kazuto Nakazawa and is a direct prequel to the first film. It follows the story of a down-on-his-luck private detective, Ash , on what he calls the \"case to end all cases\". Ash receives an anonymous phone call to search for a hacker that goes by the alias \"Trinity\" . Ash traces Trinity and learns that other detectives have failed in the same task before him; one had committed suicide, one had gone missing, and one had gone insane. He then attempts to speak with the insane detective but cannot get anything substantial out of him. This detective is an African American with a thin mustache who shows a resemblance to Walter Mosley's detective character 'Ezekiel \"Easy\" Rawlins'. This is a possible homage to the character as Mosley's detective series is set in a similar Noir type setting and there were not many black detectives at the time. Eventually Ash finds Trinity after deducing that he should communicate using phrases and facts from Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. She proposes a meeting, and he successfully finds the location. At the meeting she removes a \"bug\" from his eye, planted by Agents earlier in an \"eye exam dream\". Agents appear and attempt to apprehend Trinity in a shoot-out with her and Ash. While the two fugitives are trying to escape the train, an Agent attempts to take over Ash's body, forcing Trinity to shoot him in order to prevent the Agent from appearing. Ash is wounded, whereupon he and Trinity bid farewells without malice. Trinity escapes, telling Ash that she thinks he could have handled the truth. Agents enter the car to find Ash, who points his gun at them while looking in the other direction and lighting a cigarette. The Agents turn to Ash who, even though he is armed, will likely die. With this apparent no-win situation, the film ends with Ash's line  as his lighter flame goes out.Easy Rawlins  {{Redirect}} Matriculated was written and directed by Korean American director Peter Chung, widely known for his work on Aeon Flux. Like Beyond, it is a midquel of the first or second film. The film deals with a group of above-ground human rebels who lure hostile intelligent machines to their laboratory in order to capture them and insert them into a \"matrix\" of their own design. Within this matrix, the humans attempt to teach the captured machines some of the positive traits of humanity, primarily compassion and empathy. The ultimate goal of this project is to help the intelligent machines develop free will in order to overcome their original \"search-and-destroy\" programming, rather than reprogramming it by force. The rebels' hope is that, once converted of its own volition , an \"enlightened\" machine will assist Zion in its struggle against the machine-controlled totalitarianism which currently dominates the Earth. After capturing one of the \"runner\" robots, the rebels insert the machine into their matrix. The experience of the robot leads it to believe it may have a relationship with one of the female rebels, Alexa , either friendship or something deeper. However, the rebel group is attacked by the Machines and unplug themselves to defend their headquarters, but they experience what might be considered a Pyrrhic Victory: all the onscreen rebels are killed but the single robot captured in the film successfully 'reprogrammed', indicated by the machine's mechanical eye changing from red to green. The robot plugs the dying Alexa into their matrix with itself, the only two things left surviving. Much to the machine's dismay, when the rebel realizes she is trapped inside the matrix with the \"friendly\" robot, she turns horrified and her avatar dissolves screaming as she clutches her head, and the robot exits from the rebels' matrix to see a motionless Alexa in front of him in the real world. The film ends with the 'converted' robot standing outside the headquarters of the human rebels, with a light on its back now turned back to the color red.  Final Flight of the Osiris was written by the The Wachowskis and directed by Andy Jones, with CG-animation production and design by Square Pictures, this segment is rated PG-13 by the MPAA for \"Sci-Fi Violence, Sensuality and Language\". The short is a direct prequel leading into the events of The Matrix Reloaded. Thadeus , a muscular man and an athletic woman called Jue  engage in a blindfolded sword fight in a virtual-reality dojo. With each slice of their swords, they remove another piece of each other's clothing. Immediately after cutting the other down to their underwear, they lift their blindfold to peek at the other. As the two are about to kiss, they are interrupted by an alarm and the virtual reality simulation ends. In the next scene, the hovercraft Osiris is headed for Junction 21 when Robbie , the operator, picks up thousands of Sentinels on his HR scans. The ship flees into an uncharted tunnel, where it encounters another group of Sentinels patrolling the area. The crewmembers man the guns onboard and destroy the patrol. The ship then emerges on the surface, four kilometers directly above Zion and close to the army of Sentinels previously detected in the scan. Alerted to the Osiris's presence, the army of Sentinels pursue the ship. Captain Thadeus decides Zion must be warned, and his shipmate Jue volunteers to broadcast herself into the Matrix to deliver the warning while the ship is doggedly pursued. Jue and Thadeus admit to peeking at each other in the VR simulation. Entering the Matrix on a high rooftop, Jue jumps off and acrobatically makes her way down through structure work between two buildings. When she hits the ground in the alley below, a ripple effect is created by her impact. She drops off a package into a mail box. The package sets the prologue for Enter the Matrix. She attempts to contact Thadeus via a cell phone as the Osiris are overcome by Sentinels and crash. The Sentinels tear their way into the ship. At the time of the call, Thadeus is making a last stand to hold off the Sentinels. Shortly after Jue says \"Thadeus\" over her cell phone, the Osiris explodes, destroying many of the pursuing Sentinels. In the Matrix, Jue falls to the ground, dead, her body having been destroyed on the ship.\n","\n","    ### Response:  The Animatrix\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

Jacob is a womanizer who beds women each night, although a young woman named Hannah  recently had rejected his advances. Jacob takes pity on Cal, and offers to teach him how to pick up women. Using Jacob's teachings, Cal seduces Kate  at the bar. After this encounter, Cal manages to successfully seduce other women in the bar. He sees Emily again at his son Robbie's  parent-teacher conference. The meeting goes well until they discover Robbie's teacher is Kate, who reveals to Emily that she and Cal slept together.

Deep in the woods, away from civilization, the children are taught the ways of cult-like Christianity, the dangers of lustful temptations and the horrors of the Devil. The charismatic priest, Fr. Phineas McAllister,  who teaches the children the doctrines of their faith has unknowingly brought evil with him by reaching deep into the children's minds, preying on their fears in an attempt to control the next generation. The priest fills these young minds with the belief that everywhere they turn an occasion of sin awaits them. He warns the young men about the demonic dangers of masturbation, because masturbation according to the priest opens the door to the imagination and gives the Devil access to the mind.

Eva's death is announced in a movie theater and a public funeral is held in Buenos Aires. Che , an everyman, narrates the story of Eva's rise to power and later illness and death, appearing in many different guises and serving as Eva's conscience and critic. As a young child, Eva attempts to attend her father's funeral in the town of Jun√≠n with her mother and siblings. Despite her father's wife and other family denying her family from entering, Eva pays her last respects to her father. Years later, Eva decides to leave Jun√≠n to seek a better life in Buenos Aires with a tango singer, Agust√≠n Magaldi , with whom she is having an affair. After Magaldi leaves her, she progresses through several relationships with increasingly influential men, becoming a model, actress and radio personality, until her fateful meeting with Colonel Juan Per√≥n  at a fundraiser. Per√≥n's connection with Eva lends him a populist air, since she is from the working class . Eva has a radio show during Per√≥n's rise and uses all her skills to promote Per√≥n, even when the controlling administration has him jailed in an attempt to stunt his political momentum. The groundswell of support Eva generates forces the government to release Per√≥n, and he finds the people enamored of him and Eva. Per√≥n wins election to the presidency and Eva promises the new government will serve the \"descamisados\" . At the start of the Per√≥n government, Eva glamors herself up in fur and jewels and enjoys the privileges of being the first lady. Soon after, Eva embarks on the infamous \"Rainbow Tour\" to Europe. While there she gets mixed receptions from the people; the people of Spain adore her; the people of Italy call her whore and throw things (such as [[Egg  at her, while the Pope gives her a small, meager gift; and the French, while kind to her were also upset that she was forced to leave early as \"she seemed to lose interest, she seemed tired\"; . Upon returning to Argentina, Eva establishes a foundation and distributes aid while the Per√≥nists otherwise plunder the public treasury. Argentine society is very class-based, and the military officer corps and social elites despise Eva's common roots and affinity for the poor. However, over time, as Eva's illness begins to worsen, she is hospitalized and told she is terminally ill. Eventually, as her illness progresses, she declines the position of Vice President she was offered and makes one final broadcast to the people of Argentina. Towards the end of her life, she understands that her life was short because she shone like the \"brightest fire\" and helps Per√≥n prepare to go on without her. A large crowd surrounds the Casa Rosada in a candlelight vigil praying for her recovery when the light of her room goes out, signifying her death. Eva's funeral is shown again. Ch√© is seen at her coffin, laying the blame of her death on Per√≥n. Then he walks up to her glass coffin; kisses it; and walks into the crowd of passing mourners.\n","\n","    ### Response:  Evita\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

Rumack convinces Ted to fly the plane, though Ted feels unable to handle the pressure and the unfamiliar aircraft. McCroskey knows that he must get someone else to help talk the plane down and calls Rex Kramer . Kramer was Ted's commanding officer in the war, and despite their dislike, would be the best choice to instruct Striker. As the plane nears Chicago, Ted becomes increasingly stressed and can only land the plane after a pep talk from Dr. Rumack. Furthermore, lightning storms strike the plane, disabling some of its engines. With Kramer's stream of advice, Ted is able to overcome his fears and engine troubles and safely land the plane with only minor injuries to some passengers. Ted's courage rekindles Elaine's love for him, and the two share a kiss while Otto takes off in the evacuated plane after inflating a female companion.\n","\n","    ### Response:  Airplane!\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

Grant'], Released in the year: 1999, Summary of the movie plot: The Jack Bull is about a normal Horse trader Myrl Redding  who cherishes the law and his rights. He lives a normal life with his son, Cage , his wife Cora  and his good friends. However he clashed one day with Land Baron Henry Ballard  over Wyoming's bid for statehood. If Wyoming remains a territory Henry Ballard can continue to buy more land and eventually evict its residents, however if Wyoming becomes a state then his rights to the land will be restricted. After further conflict with Ballard, Redding attempts to take his horses to a horse market in Casper. However he encounters Ballard, who has built a tollgate that blocks the road to Casper, charging a fee for passage. Redding realizes going around would take too long to get the horses to market on time, with the market closed before he could arrive. Ballard tells Redding that he will allow Redding to cross with a fee of ten dollars. Redding gives him five and leaves two black stallions as collateral for the other five. He also leaves his Indian friend and worker Billy to make sure the horses are not mistreated. Redding arrives at Casper on time and sells his horses, with the exception of the two he left behind and makes his way back to his home. He stops for his horses and finds Billy is missing and his horses are starved, diseased, beaten, and near death. He beats one of Ballard's henchmen and demands that his horses be returned healthy and fed. Ballard says he'll never do it and Redding leaves, saying he has two weeks to comply with his demands. Ballard ignores him and returns to his normal life. Redding returns home and finds Billy beaten and bitten. Billy describes how one of Ballard's henchmen had the two horses chained to a wagon of logs and was beating them when they rested even though they had been working for hours. Billy attempted to stop him but he was attacked by two other henchmen who then set the dogs on him. He said he was forced to flee and would've been killed if he had returned. Redding agrees with Billy and sympathizes with him, telling him it was not his fault for what happened to the horses. He departs that day for the local town and approaches the local lawyer and asks for legal help. The lawyer tells Redding he will probably not win because it is an Indian's word against a wealthy white man's. Redding says to do it anyway and leaves after paying ten dollars in lawyer fees. A week passes and nothing happens, and Redding tells his lawyer to speed up the case. The lawyer intercepts Judge Wilkins, the local judge, on the way to the barber and pleads for a chance to make their case. Wilkins, who has a financial interest in Ballard's business, tells them that he is throwing the case out and advises the lawyer to choose his clients more carefully, stating \"You're shoveling shit out of the mountain.\" The lawyer informs Redding about Judge Wilkins decision and after his wife finds out she tells Redding that she is good friends with the District Attorney's wife, and she departs for Casper to plead their case before the D.A. She and Woody, Redding's trusted friend, depart for Casper and he drops her off in front of the D.A.'s office. When she arrives at the office she is informed she needs an appointment and she reluctantly leaves after leaving her name. However unknown to her two of Ballard's henchmen had beaten Woody and thrown him into a carriage, knocking the driver off. The wild carriage runs her over as she is crossing the street, making her death a very unfortunate coincidence caused by Ballard's men. Woody gives the documented complaint against Ballard directly to the D.A., who emerges to see what has happened. Woody then drives Cora's body back to Myrl's household where they bury her. To make matters worst Redding's lawyer returns with news that the D.A. has sent the case back to Judge Wilkins, who has once again thrown the case out. Redding, distraught with the loss of his wife and realizing that the justice system will do nothing to stop Ballard, takes justice into his own hands and rallies the local farmers against Ballard. Although some have doubts he talks them into joining him with the offer that he will pay each man who joins him fifteen dollars a month. Redding and his new militia of farmers ride towards Ballard's house where they route Ballard's men and Ballard himself flees for his life for Casper. Redding burns down Ballard's stable and leaves for the local town, looking for Ballard. After questioning a local farmer who refuses to tell them Ballard's location, he burns down the farmer's barn and leaves the barn smoldering. They then ride to a local Amish community and threaten to burn down the houses if they hide Ballard or refuse to give them the location. After the Amish people tell him they don't even know Ballard, he asks for a person who knows how to print. They find one and offer him fifteen dollars to mass produce fliers demanding Ballard that he has a week to get the horses fed and healthy. Ballard meanwhile, had reached Casper and pleads for help from the Governor of Wyoming himself. The Governor offers protection and charges the Sheriff to find and arrest Redding. But after only a day of searching, the Sheriff is ambushed during the night and during a brief struggle Redding kills one of Ballard's men, Slater, after he attempts to shoot Billy. He forces the sheriff at gunpoint to say that it was self defense, and after Redding departs the Sheriff returns to Casper and tells news that Slater was shot dead by Redding. Meanwhile Billy, while riding back to Ballard's house is shot by its caretaker Conrad. After a brief firefight Conrad shoots his wife by accident and Billy and Redding leave. Meanwhile the Governor, after conversing with Judge Joe B. Tolliver  and the Attorney General decides to offer Redding amnesty if he turns himself in. Redding accepts but Billy doesn't, saying that land Ballard took belonged to his native tribe. Billy leaves and Redding arrives in Casper to participate in the trial of Henry Ballard. During the trial however the D.A.'s assistant informs them that Judge Wilkins is charging Redding with two counts of murder and armed insurrection. However the amnesty agreement was typed before the charges were sent, putting the Governor in a bind. If he charges Redding, he will break the amnesty agreement, but if he doesn't charge Redding, he will be violating a judge's charges. The governor decides he will charge Redding if he breaks the amnesty agreement. The trial ends after several witnesses testify that the horses were indeed healthy stallions although Ballard testifies otherwise. Judge Tolliver agrees with Redding and orders Ballard to restore the horses to their previous health. Meanwhile, Billy has sued Ballard for the land rights but is losing, so he sends a messenger to Redding in an attempt to gain leverage over Ballard. Redding writes a letter of support but the messenger is ambushed while leaving Redding's hotel. The letter is used as proof to show Redding has violated his amnesty and he is charged with two counts of murder and armed insurrection. He is found guilty one one count of murder and armed insurrection at the same time that Billy and his Indians are ambushed by the Wyoming Army. Redding is sentenced to be hung and Ballard is charged with perjury for lying under oath and sentenced to two years in jail, three months of which will be spent restoring the two stallions' health. Further consequence is that Ballard will lose his life savings. On the day of the hanging Redding meets with his son and tells him to always work hard and never give up. After a heartfelt goodbye Redding is called to inspect the two horses. After confirming that they have been restored, Ballard curses him and claims Redding got nothing from Ballard. Redding replies simply, \"You did what I said you would.\" Ballard is carried away screaming and Redding is marched to the gallows. Judge Tolliver, who seems compassionate toward Redding and his principles, finds Judge Wilkins in a bar. Tolliver angrily berates him for charging an innocent man with murder. He then says that he has sent a letter to the governor asking for a committee, that he'll oversee, to review Wilkins' ability to be a judge, and says he hopes they will find him unable. Judge Wilkins, obviously distraught, attempts to order a drink, to which the bartender replies, \"Ten dollars a shot\", mocking the judge about how Ballard charged Redding ten dollars to cross the land and how Wilkins did nothing about it. The bartender leaves Wilkins miserable and dishonored. Redding walks to the gallows but not before being hugged by his son and another heartfelt goodbye. He is hung and various clips show. One is of his son, Cage and Woody leading the two stallions along with Redding's body away from the city back home. Another shows the Wyoming marching band parading down the street announcing Wyoming has become a state.\n","\n","    ### Response: 100 Proof\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

His 19-year-old son Marius works for him at his bar, but wants nothing more than to go to sea and leave his boring existence behind. The only thing holding him back is Fanny, an 18-year-old girl with whom he grew up. Fanny works selling fish with her mother down at the waterfront. Fanny has been in love with Marius her whole life, and flirts with him, but Marius always rejects her. Fanny invites Marius to a Sunday night dance, but he rejects her once more. Unbeknownst to Fanny, Marius is planning to leave the next day, having secretly signed on as a sailor on a lengthy scientific expedition traveling around the world after being encouraged to do so by his friend known as the Admiral. Fanny is offended and leaves. Meanwhile, elderly but wealthy merchant Panisse asks to meet with Fanny's mother Honorine, who believes he wants to propose to her. To her surprise, he wants to marry Fanny, even though he knows she loves someone else. Although disappointed, Honorine does not object, seeing as Panisse is worth 600,000 francs. Fanny tells Marius she has rejected Panisse's proposal because she loves him and is willing to wait until he returns. Marius tells her he will be away for five years and to forget about him. They declare their love for each other and go to Fanny's house, which is empty while her mother is away. The following morning, Honorine discovers Fanny and Marius in bed together. She and C√©sar begin to plan their children's wedding, but Fanny urges Marius to leave, even lying to him, telling him that she would rather marry a rich man like Panisse than she would him. But, in truth, she is fearful he eventually will grow to hate her for depriving him of this great opportunity. Around two months after Marius goes off to sea, Fanny discovers she is pregnant with Marius's child and tells Panisse the news. He is happy to marry her anyway, overjoyed with the possibility of a male heir to carry on his name. They marry and Fanny gives birth to a boy to whom C√©sar is godfather. C√©sar, knowing the baby's true father, collaborates with Panisse to give the baby the name C√©sario Marius Panisse. On C√©sario's first birthday, Panisse leaves on the train to Paris on business, and while he is gone, Marius returns on a short leave. He visits Fanny, and upon learning her child is his, apologizes to Fanny, as he knows now she said those things only to make him go. Marius tells her that he wants her back, but then C√©sar comes in before anything can happen. Panisse then arrives home early and says that he will not try to stop Fanny from leaving with Marius but he will not part with the child, knowing that Fanny won't leave without the boy. Fanny tells Marius she loves him but will not take C√©sario from Panisse, as it was Panisse who had been there for Fanny and C√©sario all along. C√©sar advises his son the father is \"the one who loves,\" and Panisse loves this child and has been a wonderful father to him. Marius then departs with neither Fanny nor his child. Ten years later, C√©sario is looking forward to his birthday party. After being taken to the waterfront with Fanny's mother, C√©sario wanders off and meets the Admiral. The Admiral takes the boy sailing without telling anyone and reunites him with Marius, though C√©sario has no idea who Marius is. Marius, who is now working in a garage, is overjoyed to see his son, but when Panisse is told the boy is missing, he is stricken and taken to his room. Fanny finds C√©sario with his father and is shocked. She announces that Panisse is dying and Marius drives them home to the dying Panisse. When they arrive at the house, Panisse calls for C√©sario to sit with him, leaving Fanny and Marius together. Fanny explains to Marius she never told him about the baby because she fully expected him to take her with him and, when he didn't, she felt betrayed and was angry. Fanny then goes to Panisse and as he lies dying, Panisse dictates a letter asking Marius to marry his wife once he is dead, and be a father to C√©sario; his only request being that the boy keep his last name.\n","\n","    ### Response:  Fanny\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

Del Green ([[Donovan Leitch  is an honors student, highly motivated, who‚Äôs dream is to dance on the Perry Parker show with Vicky . Vicky is a the blond parochial school student, and the shows most popular dancer. One afternoon Del bets his school friends that he will indeed dance with ‚ÄòThe In Crowd‚Äô. The day he chooses happens to be Dugan‚Äôs  first day of banishment. He uses some trickery to get thru the stage door security goons and sneaks into the pre-show dressing room where the ‚Äòin crowd‚Äô muster. He‚Äôs new but not yet a threat to this self-centered group. Vicky shows up late. With the loss of their star male dancer, Dugan, Perry enters the dressing room with a ‚Äòheavy heart‚Äô and a need for one of the other boys to step up and replace Dugan as Vickie‚Äôs partner. Del jumps into the breach, combs his hair and gets a smile from Vicky, and threatening faces from the others. His first appearance is a big hit. TV cameras follow him and his more than adequate dancing with his smiling partner Vicky. The ‚Äòin crowd‚Äô now a bit jealous try to sabotage him during a line dance, but Dell dances his way out of harms way. His friends all watching from home can‚Äôt really believe that Del is so hip, cool and ‚Äòalive‚Äô while dancing. The shows audience of young teens really take a likening to Dell and aren‚Äôt a bit set back at Dugan‚Äôs demise. The show‚Äôs ratings go up and the management likes the new lead dancer, Del is a new member of the ‚ÄòIn Crowd‚Äô. Perry tells the cast to include Del in all their evening and daytime group outings, and Del agrees to even pick up Vicky at her home. Vicky agrees though she has ulterior motives. Del‚Äôs visits Vicky and her mom is in a cloud and sort of floats in time. Her is Tiny, a policeman and later is happy to see a smart college bound young man, a welcome change from Dugan. Del‚Äôs first evening, the group meets at the Germantown Train Station, Vicky sneaks away with Dugan, while the ‚ÄòIn Crowd‚Äô puts Del through a Miller beer shower initiation ceremony, an edgy, ruff experience that Del handles very well. Later Vicky returns, Del takes her home and Tiny forces her to give him a goodnight kiss. A good time was had by all. Del is now a full-fledged ‚ÄòIn Crowd‚Äô member. Next day, Perry Parker and a couple of his muscle men, disrupt Del‚Äôs American English Class where Perry ends up leading the discussion of a ‚ÄòTale of Two Cities‚Äô with the theme of ‚ÄòDying for Love‚Äô. Perry does a layman's rendition of the immensity of dying for love versus his teens just ‚Äòfeeling like they could die for love‚Äô. His thoughts impress the English teacher and show just how ‚Äòin tune‚Äô Perry is with his teens and his audience. Del is dragged out to the car to ogle the hundreds of adoring fan letters sent to him in care of the show. He is offered, ‚Äòpayola, extra money‚Äô for playing a bigger role in that day‚Äôs show. He gets to do the ‚ÄòLover‚Äôs Only‚Äô spotlight dance with Vicky, another big hit for the show and with the home fans and stage audience as well. There are several outings with the ‚ÄòIn Crowd‚Äô, one is on a Philly bus in the market area, lots of dancing, sight gags, teens being teens and the locals joining in with their own dance routines. Good scenes, somewhat in the tradition of the Beatles in a ‚ÄòHard Days Night‚Äô. Vicky and Del are pushed together by show bizz necessity, and they become close, but still there‚Äôs Dugan lurking and scheming in the background. A key daytime outing was to the boardwalk in Wildwood, New Jersey. We see Del and Vicky dressed in wedding costumes and being shown with the Wildwood teens going from business to business on the boardwalk. Perry melts down at a caricature of Dick Clark and has Morris  pay for the destruction of all the drawings. After a photo shoot at Carmines in their Tux and Wedding gown, Del and Vicky meet with the crowd of teens at the end of the pier. Here teens buy record albums so they can be part of a multiplication dance with Del and Vicky. During the middle of the song, Moon River, Del abandons his partner and walks over to invite a young girl to dance with him. She‚Äôs younger than the others, very pretty, dark hair, big eyes and a smile soon to melt everyone‚Äôs heart. She‚Äôs very shy, and doesn‚Äôt feel she can slow dance. She wears a leg brace and has an awkward limp. Del ignores her fear, takes her by both hands, walks to the center of the dance floor and starts dancing. Everyone is stunned at this generous and gracious dance offer by Del. Everyone stalls, stares and smiles at the dancing couple, some swoon. Del and his young partner lean into each other and she puts her head on his chest, smiles and becomes a magical dance partner. One beautifully happy girl becomes the perfect Wildwood teen, her smile seems as large as Del's heart. It‚Äôs a perfect dance scene, the music, the teens all vicariously dancing along with Dell and the young girl. Del returns Vicky home in the rain and at his home finds an open front door. Dugan is there, to challenge Del on his relationship with Vicki. He turns on the stereo, and they have a dance off right there in the living room, each trying to out dance the other, leaps, turning over the sofa, and tumbling off the walls. It ends in a stalemate where both fall back onto the sofa. Dugan opens up with his bigger than life plans to go to California and become a movie star. He struggles with the words in reading few paragraphs from a movie magazine, while Del listens and sees Dugan‚Äôs earnestness and desire to be a success. He also senses that Dugan is a good guy and well-meaning suitor for Vicky. Dugan really dreams of Vicky becoming another Natalie Wood, a dream both Vicky and he share. At the end of the visit, the two young men know what‚Äôs up, and Gail  his next door neighbor drops in for a visit and is roughly kissed by Dugan. He leaves and Gail tells Del that he‚Äôs hanging out with the ‚Äòwrong crowd‚Äô and is not going to make it into a good ivy league college, and by the way he is alienating his school friends. Del is caught in between the two worlds, his old friends and his more famous, edgy and exciting ‚ÄòIn Crowd‚Äô friends. Vicky invites Del over to work on her homework and he thinks it‚Äôs just another ruse to get out of the house and go on another date with Dugan. Turns out the she really wanted to work a bit on her school work and be with him not Dugan. More friction emerges in another date where Del takes Vicky to see Gail perform in her senior class play. At dinner after the play Vicky is humiliated by Gail and her dinner group when Vicky tells them that she is reading a piece of ‚Äòfriction‚Äô. Vicky doesn‚Äôt understand her error, but stands, excuses herself and pauses to tell Gail that she really enjoyed Gail‚Äôs performance in the play. A great cudo from her heart that catches the whole table by surprise. Del angrily leaves to find her. The British invasion has hurt the Perry Parker show ratings, so after he interviews a crude bunch of Brits, Perry goes ballistic. This turns out to be the last show, so Perry gives the ‚ÄòIn Crowd‚Äô instructions to cut loose, they dances wildly and are blacked out. Del takes out Vicky one more time with a borrowed car he gets through Gail. His plan was for Vicky to meet Dugan and run off to Hollywood, somehow Tiny gets wind of the plan and tries to stop the couple, Del crashes the borrowed Caddy into his police car to free Dugan and Vicky who make their escape on Dugan‚Äôs motorcycle. The last scene shows a grounded Del in his house. Gail comes by to play a new kind of music for him, Bob Dylan, while she wears a leather headband, mini-skirt and high top suede boots.He is stunned by her new appearance and can't take his eyes off of her. She feels connected to Del via the Dylan music/poetry, and Del finds solace in his re-ordered life. The two share a charged look, perhaps hinting of things to come.\n","\n","    ### Response: 16 Candles\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

Thrown out of the house by his mother and ignored by his more academically gifted and successful younger brother, Louis, he had a hard time running away from debt collectors until one day he met a young girl named Gigi after a run-in with some of the debt collectors' men. Gigi started out as a thief, but because she fell for him and gave him immense luck, Andy gained great success with his extreme good luck in mahjong games and became very rich. However he refused to marry Gigi because she, though a nice woman when with him, was in reality quite a sore loser who threw temper tantrums while on the verge of losing mahjong games. She could not understand that he couldn't stand the way she behaved. As Andy said, her behaviour could be revealed by just playing a game of mahjong where when she lost, she would throw the tables. He promised her that he would marry her if she could play a game of mahjong without such a bad temper. She couldn't and so he couldn't marry her though he loved her. In the meantime, Andy found his mother who was now suffering from Alzheimer's disease and his brother who faced bankruptcy and moved in with Andy, who coincidentally lived in a bungalow. Not wanting to lose out in finding a job, Louis who had excellent luck in Mahjong but zero skill, was conned out of all his money and even his clothes by a skilled, yet devious mahjong player, Sean, portrayed by Lau Ching-wan. But being a kind hearted simpleton, a woman on the con team,  fell for him and decided to mend her ways. In the meantime, Gigi who was very disappointed with Andy's refusal to marry her, went with the bad crowd, in the form of mahjong con men led by Lau Ching-wan.

The lander carries two astronauts, one of them a black male model, James Washington, specifically chosen to aid the President of the United States in her re-election . Upon landing on the Far side of the Moon they encounter the Nazis who have hidden there since 1945. Washington is taken captive and the other astronaut killed. Nazi scientist Doktor Richter investigates Washington and finds his smartphone. Although initially skeptical, he recognizes that its computing power outstrips all their technology combined. Moreover it serves perfectly as a control unit for space battleship G√∂tterd√§mmerung. When he strives to demonstrate the completion of his Wunderwaffe to the current F√ºhrer, Wolfgang Kortzfleisch, the phone runs out of power. Nazi commander Klaus Adler, who is  chosen to mate with Earth specialist Renate Richter, Doktor Richter's daughter, offers to go to Earth to collect more phones. Adler takes a spacecraft to Earth, taking James with him, who has been bleached by Richter. Upon landing they find that Renate has stowed away and travelled with them. Meanwhile on Earth, the President of the United States has to tackle political issues; she desperately needs a miracle to ensure her re-election. Her aide, Vivian Wagner , introduces the Nazi couple to her. Adler and Richter go on to revamp the President's campaign Nazi-style, with apparent success, while the clueless Richter is unaware of Adler's ambition to become the next F√ºhrer and rule the world. After three months, Kortzfleisch seems to have figured out Adler's plan. He sends his armada  to Earth orbit. He himself lands on Earth and confronts Adler, but is consequently killed by him and Vivian. Adler declares himself the new F√ºhrer before he returns to orbit with Kortzfleisch's flying saucer. At the same time, Renate Richter comes across the now homeless Washington who makes her realise that terrestrial Nazis are not to her liking. The United Nations assemble to discuss the extra-terrestrial Nazi threat. The President is excited to finally have a war which will likely get her re-elected, and appoints Vivian Wagner as commander of the spacecraft USS George W. Bush, which orbits the Earth carrying nuclear weapons. As it turns out, most of the other nations have also developed armed spacecraft, and join in to defeat the invading Nazi armada. Back on Earth, Richter convinces Washington to come with her back to the Moon to stop Adler. They take Adler's flying saucer back to the Moon and to the G√∂tterd√§mmerung, where Washington attempts to disable the engines while Renate goes looking for Adler. Meanwhile, the international spacecraft armada has destroyed the Swastika moonbase and is heading for the G√∂tterd√§mmerung as well. In the final battle, Washington manages to disconnect the tablet device now controlling the G√∂tterd√§mmerung while Richter takes out Adler. The spaceship crashes into the Moon, but not before Adler has taken out a considerable chunk of the Moon attempting to get a clear shot at the Earth. The U.S. President calls Wagner from the UN session, congratulating her on her victory. Wagner discloses she detected large tanks of Helium-3 on the Moon. This material would keep the United States independent of foreign power sources for a millennium. Consequently the U.S. president immediately lays claim to it. This enrages a white-haired UN member  who throws his shoe at her. All UN members join the following \"meeting hall battle\". This leads to an international turmoil and eventually even the international spacecraft of the hitherto allied nations start attacking each other. Richter meets up with Washington  in the damaged Swastika moonbase, where they embrace in front of Richter's flabbergasted former students and some adults who have fled there from other parts of the base. Richter states that \"[they] have a lotta work cut out for [them]\". The final moments of the film show the Earth, where missiles are causing nuclear explosions across the globe.

At breakfast, the older brothers, Jorge  and Sergio  argue with their father Humberto . The boys are studying at the university and their father works at the Departamento del Distrito Federal . The argument begins when the father complains that the boys have long hair. The argument escalates and then they begin to argue that what the boys are doing is wrong, and that \"no one should question the government\". The boys say that the autonomy of the university was violated and that the government does things against the constitution. Their grandfather Roque  , says that \"If they were on a real revolution, they would be executed\". The younger siblings Carlos  and Graciela , who study primary and secondary school, barely understand what the argument is all about, because of their young age. The boys then talk about the injustice of the government. Their prime example is the occupation of the U.N.A.M. and that some students hid in the bathroom, and their corpses were found the day before . The mother, Alicia  tries to calm down the situation and tells the boys to \"come early and cut their hair\". The boys jokingly state that Miguel Hidalgo had long hair , then leave. The day continues normally and then, while cooking, Alicia and Graciela argue about what the boys are doing. Graciela says that her mother is \"out of style\", then says that she would like to continue studying, to which her mother replies that she will end up being a homemaker anyway. Carlos is getting ready for school while listening to the Beatles, his grandfather complains that \"they're too loud\" and turns the radio off. Humberto tries to call his wife and tells her that \"something big is about to happen and that he is worried\", but before he can continue the phone dies. Alicia asks Graciela to go to the neighbor's apartment and try to call her father. Graciela does so and finds out that the neighbor's phone is dead. She returns and says that the phones do not work, \"neither ours, nor the neighbor's, nor the one in the corner\". Sometime later, the light goes out as well. Don Roque goes to the bottom floor and changes the fuse. He bumps into the neighbor on the way and they both change fuses. They then try to turn on the light and discover that the light got cut out. Don Roque then returns to the apartment and tells Alicia that the light does not work. They both worry and carry on with their day. Carlos returns from school. He tells his mother that he asked the teacher whether what his brothers said was true, and says the teacher confirmed it. He then goes outside to the building's hall to play with his toy soldiers with his grandfather. As they are playing, suspicious men with sniper rifles and white handkerchiefs in their left hands try to take a look through an opening on the hall. They find it \"inappropriate\" and go to upstairs floors. The two return to the apartment and Don Roque talks with his daughter about the military presence and the snipers at the roof of each building. Why? She asks. The answer is very simple: because they are prepared for something big. Alicia starts sewing something, Carlos does his homework and Don Roque tries to repair a watch. At the square outside, a crowd begins to gather. A student meeting is taking place. Carlos and Graciela watch the crowd and estimate more than 10,000 present. Graciela then goes to a friend's house to do her homework. After half an hour, the meeting is interrupted as red and green flares soar across the sky. Carlos sees this, excited, and tells his mom. Alicia peeks through the window and sees that the students are being slaughtered. Don Roque tells them to get away from the window and to hide in his room. As they do so, two bullets pierce the window. After some time, Don Roque tries to pick up Graciela, but before he does, he hears a sound. \"Tanks!\" he exclaims. Then it starts to rain. After some time, there are sounds from outside. The door opens and Serigio and Jorge  arrive, along with some mates. One of them, Luis , is wounded. Alicia tries to heal him, but he is bleeding badly. The shooting goes on and stops. During that time, the soaked students begin to trade stories. One of them says that he was on the building's third floor balcony, where the speech was being given, and said that armed people dressed as civilians yelled \"Olimpia Batallion! Nobody move!\". Another one says that he was leaving when the shooting started. The brothers say that the speaker yelled to the crowd \"not to fall on provocations\". Luis says that he was from the \"Poli\"  and was running with the crowd when he felt pain in his elbow, then found out he was shot, then afterwards lost his little sister. Another one claims that two dead children no older than 10 ended up on top of each other. A female student claims she saw the Plaza full of shoes. The students peek through the pierced window and see \"nothing but shadows\" . Don Roque arrives with Graciela and some soldiers, who are in the search for students. Don Roque says that he was a captain in the Revolution and searches for his papers. As he does so, the snipers come from upstairs holding three blood-soaked students. They punch them and then are told to \"take them with the others\". Don Roque comes back and gives his papers to the soldier, who tells them not to open to anyone. The old man goes back inside and says that the students were arrested and sent to military trucks, as well as that there were garbage trucks and firemen outside. Graciela says that they had to take the stairs and saw the elevator's doors pierced by bullets. Her mother says that it was practically impossible since they were \"made of thick steel\". The female student, who held the propaganda money, talks with Alicia. Alicia keeps the money on a jar until \"things get calm\", then says that the girl's parents would be worried, but the girl does not think so. Alicia says that it was impossible, \"by this time, the whole country is already aware of what happened here\", but the girl answers that \"not everything that the news says is true, and not everything that happens makes it into the news as well\". She goes into the bathroom to dry her soaked hair, when Graciela confronts her telling her \"to be a woman and not to be in Men Things\", to which the student replies \"this is a matter of both men and women\". Humberto calls and tells the family not to open to anyone. In a short time, some boys call their houses to assure their families they're OK. A second shooting ensues and the lights are shut down. The group sleeps and a woman starts crying outside looking for his son \"To√±o\". The students awake and ask if anyone is named To√±o. None of them is named like so. Finally, the lights come back on and Humberto arrives. He says that \"it was really hard to get past the security\". He also says that ambulances were on the surrounding area of the square, but none of them seemed to take the wounded to hospitals and that students were stripped and pushed to the bottom floor's elevator walls. One of the students asks whether they were being beaten up. Humberto confirms this harshly. They then turn the T.V. on and the local news says that the shooting took place because \"student snipers on the nearby buildings fired at the army, which was sent to support the police\". One of the students says the obvious: the government controls the local news as well, confirming the female student's claims. The group then goes to sleep, while the students plan their escape: the next day they'll \"leave the house one by one\". At the eerie sights of morning, the snipers bang on the door. After a harsh awakening, the students hide in the bathroom and one of them tells Humberto not to open. Carlos hides under his bed and the boys pretend to be asleep. Humberto asks who they are, but the snipers insist on opening. Humberto opens and the snipers act fiercely, pointing their guns at everyone. Humberto tells them of his position at the government, but they don't seem to care. They force everyone out of their beds and discover the boys' room full of leftist propaganda: \"The Communist Manifesto\" and a Che Guevara poster on their wall. They are forced to get out of their room and are asked if they were in on the meeting. Jorge answers, but Sergio does not and is pistol-whipped. They discover the bathroom is locked and Don Roque says Carlos is inside because he's scared. They then inspect the apartment because of the boys' leftist propaganda and find the blood-stained sheet on which Luis laid. Then they threaten to kill Humberto at gunpoint if the bathroom door does not open. Sergio, his mouth still full of blood, begs his mates to open the door. One of the snipers, meanwhile, shoots the doorknob of the bathroom and force everyone to leave. Some students stay put, while a student and the girl try to escape. Both are shot by the snipers. Other students also shout and are killed. A fight ensues. Jorge, Don Roque and Humberto try to over-power the snipers as Sergio and Graciela escape. The snipers win and shoot everyone. They then run to the hall to search for Sergio and Graciela. Two gunshots are heard. Carlos is the sole survivor as he gets out of his bed and sees the corpses in the hall. He starts to cry and goes barefoot down the blood-stained stairs. He sees his brother's corpse on the stairs with two bullet holes on his chest, then keeps walking down and finds his sister dead in at the foot of some stairs. He manages to get to the bullet-hit bottom floor and sees two soldiers, while in the background a government janitor  sweeps the floor, which contains student propaganda, finally the film ends.\n","\n","    ### Response: ¡Que viva la revolución!\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

Casey Edwards , the house detective, tries to clear Freddie, but Inspector Wellman  and Sergeant Stone  keep him in custody. Seven of Strickland's former clients happen to be at the resort, and they are all suspects. These former clients are Swami Talpur , Angela Gordon , Mrs. Hargreave , T. Hanley Brooks , Lawrence Crandall , Mrs. Grimsby  and Mike Relia . They gather for a meeting, and decide that they must conceal their pasts and that Freddie must take the blame for Strickland's murder. They try unsuccessfully to get Freddie to sign a confession, e.g., Angela tries to seduce him, but the police stop her when they fear she's poisoned the champagne. Then the Swami attempts to hypnotize him into committing suicide, but his stupidity saves him. Freddie and the two police officers, in an attempt to lure the real killer, inform everyone that Freddie is in possession of a blood-stained handkerchief that was found at the murder scene. Soon afterwards, several attempts to kill Freddie are made, including gun shots at window of his booby trapped room, and locking him in a steam cabinet. Eventually Freddie hears a voice that calls him to bring the handkerchief to the Lost Cavern. There he meets up with a masked figure who offers to save him from the hole he has just fallen into in exchange for the handkerchief. Freddie makes the mistake of telling the mysterious figure that he left it in his room. He is left in the hole, but is eventually rescued by the two police officers. Back at the hotel, everyone has gathered together and Stone returns with some muddy shoes that belong to Melton , the hotel manager, which proves that he was the one in the caverns with Freddie. His motive for the murder was that he, Relia and Millford, Strickland's secretary, were blackmailing the owner Mr. Crandell. When Strickland found out, he came to investigate, so Melton killed him. Millford then sent down the former clients to use as decoys for the police, but Melton then killed Relia and Millford to cover it all up. He attempts to escape through a window, but is caught by a booby trap previously set by Freddie.\n","\n","    ### Response:  Abbott and Costello Meet the Keystone Kops\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

Following the death of one of his workers in an accident, Plainview adopts the man's orphaned son. The boy, whom he names H. W. , becomes his nominal business \"partner\". Nine years later, Plainview is approached by Paul Sunday , who tells him about the oil deposit under his family's property in Little Boston, California. Plainview attempts to buy the farm at a bargain price but Paul's twin brother Eli , wise to Plainview's plan, holds out for $5,000, wanting the money to fund the local church, of which he is the pastor. Plainview has Eli's father agree to the bargain price instead, and goes on to acquire the available land in the area, except for one holdout, William Bandy . Oil production begins. Later, an on-site accident kills a worker, and later still, a large explosion robs H. W. of his hearing. One day, a visitor  arrives on Plainview's doorstep claiming to be his half-brother, Henry, seeking work. Plainview takes the stranger in, and though H. W. discovers flaws in his story, he keeps the news to himself; the boy then attempts to kill Henry by setting his bed linen alight. Angered at his son's behavior, Plainview sends the boy away to a school in San Francisco. A representative from Standard Oil offers to buy out Plainview's local interests, but Plainview elects to strike a deal with Union Oil and construct a pipeline to the California coast, though the Bandy ranch remains an impediment. After spending more time with Henry, Plainview also becomes suspicious; Henry confesses that he was actually a friend of the real Henry, who had died from tuberculosis. Plainview kills the imposter and buries his body. The next morning, Plainview is awakened by Mr. Bandy, who appears to be aware of the previous night's events. Bandy agrees to Plainview's deal but only on the provision that the latter mend his ways and join the Church of the Third Revelation, where Eli humiliates him as part of his initiation. Plainview soon reunites with H. W., and Eli eventually leaves town to perform missionary work. In 1927, a much older H. W.  marries his childhood sweetheart, Mary Sunday . By this time his father, now an alcoholic but extremely wealthy, is living in a mansion with only a servant for company. H. W. asks his father  to dissolve their partnership so he can establish his own business. Plainview mocks his son's deafness and tells him of his true origins, leaving H. W. with no regrets when he finally leaves. Eli, now a radio host and the head of a larger church, visits Plainview. Eli, in dire financial straits, explains that Mr. Bandy has died, and offers to broker a deal on his land. Plainview agrees to the deal if Eli confesses, \"I am a false prophet; God is a superstition\", subjecting Eli to the same humiliation Eli had put him through years earlier. Eli does so after much berating by Plainview. To Eli's horror, Plainview reveals that he had already drained the oil from the property through surrounding wells by saying, \"I drink your milkshake.\" Plainview suddenly goes into a rage, chases Eli about the room, and then beats him to death with a bowling pin. When Plainview's butler comes down to check on him, Plainview simply says \"I'm finished.\"\n","\n","    ### Response:  There Will Be Blood\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

Carlito vows to be through with his criminal activities but is persuaded to accompany his young cousin Guajiro  to a drug deal held at a bar. Guajiro is betrayed and killed by his suppliers and Carlito is forced to shoot his way out. Afterwards, Carlito takes Guajiro's $30,000 from the botched deal and uses it to buy into a nightclub owned by a gambling addict named Saso  with the intent on saving $75,000 to retire to the Caribbean. As nightclub co-owner, Carlito declines several offers for a business partnership with an ambitious, albeit obnoxious, young gangster from the Bronx named Benny Blanco . Carlito also rekindles his romance with his former girlfriend Gail , a ballet dancer who moonlights as a stripper. Kleinfeld develops a love interest with Benny's girlfriend, Steffie, a waitress at Carlito's nightclub. Benny's frustration with Carlito's constant rejections boils over and he confronts Carlito one night at his table. Carlito publicly humiliates Benny, who reacts by manhandling Steffie. Fueled by his now extensive use of alcohol and cocaine, Kleinfeld brazenly pulls out a gun and threatens to kill Benny, but Carlito intervenes. Despite being personally threatened by Benny himself, Carlito lets Benny go unharmed; a decision which alienates Carlito's gangster friend and personal bodyguard Pachanga . Kleinfeld, who stole one million dollars in payoff money from his Italian mob-boss client, Anthony \"Tony T\" Taglialucci, is coerced into providing his yacht to help Tony T break out of the Rikers Island prison barge. Kleinfeld begs for Carlito's assistance in the prison break, and Carlito reluctantly agrees. Under cover of night, Carlito, Kleinfeld, and Tony T's son, Frankie, sail to a floating buoy outside of the prison barge where Tony T is waiting. As they pull Tony T aboard, Kleinfeld unexpectedly bludgeons him to death then slits Frankie's throat and dumps both of their bodies in the East River. Carlito immediately severs his ties with Kleinfeld and decides to leave town with Gail. The next day, Kleinfeld barely survives a retaliatory assassination attempt when he's stabbed in the chest at his office by two mobsters. Carlito is apprehended by police and taken to District Attorney Norwalk's  office where he is played a tape of Kleinfeld making a deal and offering to testify to false criminal allegations against Carlito. Norwalk advises that he is aware of Carlito as an accomplice to the Taglialucci murders in an attempt to leverage him into betraying Kleinfeld to save himself, but Carlito refuses. Carlito visits Kleinfeld under police protection in the hospital, where Kleinfeld confesses to selling him out; Carlito warns Kleinfeld that he's crossed the line from being a lawyer to acting like a gangster, and other gangsters will treat him accordingly. Carlito then buys train tickets to Miami for himself and Gail, now pregnant. When he stops by his club to get the stashed money, Carlito is met by a group of Italian mobsters led by Vinnie. The Italians plan on killing Carlito, but he manages to slip out through a secret exit. The Italians pursue him throughout the city's subway system and into Grand Central Terminal where they engage in a gunfight. Carlito kills all of his pursuers except Vinnie, who is shot and killed by police attracted by the gunfire. As Carlito runs to catch the train where Gail and Pachanga are waiting for him, he is ambushed by a disguised Benny, who shoots Carlito several times in the abdomen with a silenced gun. Pachanga admits to the dying Carlito that he is now working for Benny, only to be shot as well. Carlito hands a tearful Gail the money and tells her to escape with their unborn child and start a new life elsewhere.

The only dwelling on the island, Fairweather Cottage, is seasonally operated by the owner Doug from the mainland and only reachable by ferry. After previously suffering a miscarriage, Kate's relationship with Martin has become tense, and in an effort to rekindle their marriage they decide on a return visit to the island. A few nights into their stay, the generator in the cottage explodes, injuring Martin's arm and leaving them without electricity. They use the CB radio, their only source of communication to the mainland, to call Doug who agrees to ferry out to help them. Kate spends the next day waiting at the jetty for Doug to arrive, but to no avail. Later a mysterious man in green combat fatigues washes up on the island, bloodied and half-conscious. When he comes round, he identifies himself as a soldier, Private Jack Coleman . He tells Martin and Kate that there has been an outbreak of an airborne disease, Argromoto Flu, codenamed R1N16, which started in South America and has spread over the entire world in the timespan of a few weeks. The virus is incurable and highly contagious, attacking the respiratory system and causing the victims to choke on blood with a 100% fatality rate. Jack says that the military has lost control, and is now advising civilians to seal themselves up in their homes and not allow anybody access. With only static now coming from the CB radio, Martin decides to play it safe and help Jack, who aggressively takes command, board up the door and the windows. Over the next few days, Jack becomes increasingly strange and erratic, and his intimidating behaviour begins to disturb the couple even further. They even suspect that the virus may not be real and Jack may be insane. When Kate asks him if he is married, he tells her his wife died of R1N16 and he becomes aggressive and threatening. Martin and Kate decide to leave the cottage and take their chances outside, but Jack refuses to let them, forcing them into the bedroom at gunpoint and locking them in. Martin sneaks outside through a skylight, finding the bodies of Doug and his wife at the pier, killed by gunshot wounds. Using Doug's hunting shotgun, Martin returns to the cottage and gets the upper hand on Jack. However, just as Kate begins to tie Jack's hands behind his back, Martin suddenly begins coughing up blood; it appears the Argromoto Flu is very real and he is infected. Kate is forced to shoot her husband dead with the shotgun, to spare him a slow and agonising death. Jack reveals to Kate that he was experimented upon at a secure military compound, from where he was released without realizing he was a carrier of R1N16. Jack infected his wife, killing her, and he fled to Blackholme Island to quarantine himself. Jack reveals the CB radio worked all along, and he just changed the settings so Kate and Martin would not be able to reach anyone. Jack fixes the CB radio and the military broadcast on it claims the soldiers have a vaccine to the virus. He tells her that the military are lying, there is no vaccine, and that the military will not allow them to leave the island alive. Kate does not believe him, and angered by the possibility that Martin could have been saved she shoots Jack dead. As she attempts to leave the island in the boat with Martin's body, a military helicopter flies over and she is killed by a sniper who shoots her in the head.\n","\n","    ### Response: 2011: The Island\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

As they drive home she tells him that she will be marrying her boyfriend as soon as she turns eighteen. He breaks down and apologizes to her before crashing their car. Seeing that she is not dead, he kills her with a broken piece of mirror, saying he couldn't let the darkness take her. The film then switches to present day, and Molly's story. Molly Hartley , a 17-year-old girl, is stabbed with scissors in the chest one day after school in the bathroom by her deranged mother Jane . Although she survives and her wound is healed with only a scar left, she is still haunted in her dreams and hears things because of the frightening experience. Molly lives with her father Robert  and her mother is locked up in a mental ward outside the town she recently moved to. Her father enrolls Molly in a new school to help with the trauma and start a new life. However, as her 18th birthday approaches, Molly must deal with both the stress of being a new student and with the continuing nightmares she has of her mother's attack. Joseph , a student at her new school, attempts to help her. However, Molly begins to display symptoms of the same psychosis that took control of her mother's life. One night, her mother escapes and tries to kidnap her, but Molly escapes. The next morning she is cornered by Jane and discovers that she, and others who share her mother's concerns, want to kill her in order to save her from a preordained life as a servant to Satan. It's revealed that Molly had died as the result of a miscarriage and her parents made a pact with the devil disguised as a woman to save her life. The terms of the agreement were such that the Hartleys would only have Molly until her 18th birthday, then she would belong to the devil. After her mother is accidentally killed by falling down to the floor and upon knocking her father out, Molly turns to Joseph for help discovering that he is one of them and has set her up by taking her to his house. Dr. Emerson  arrives at Joseph's house and tells Molly that she is also to be a servant of the devil. She says Molly can either kill her father to break the pact, or submit to the devil. She attempts to let her father live and not join the devil by stabbing herself in the chest with a kitchen knife in an effort to commit suicide. This attempt is in vain because the clock has already struck midnight. The movie switches to a mental institution, where a doctor is talking to a woman dressed in black, later revealed to be a cold-hearted Molly. It is revealed that Molly's father has now been admitted to the institution; Molly casually smiles and says she will not speak to him, instead choosing to move on. Molly becomes valedictorian of her high school, and dates Joseph. She is seen leaving her high school graduation with Joseph in a limousine, after being told by Dr. Emerson  that they'll \"see her soon.\"\n","\n","    ### Response: 18 Again\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

We meet haggard Vice Principal Rubell  and clueless Principal Horn, as well as stuffy lawyer and former JFK alumna Lisa Hammond , who is in charge of taking depositions for the Calvin case, in which a recent graduate is suing the school for giving him a diploma despite his illiteracy. Alex Jurel  is a veteran Social Studies teacher who takes his job lightly despite being one of the most popular teachers in school because of his ability to identify and connect with the students. Jurel has been worn down by years of being in-between the rowdy students and the demands of the administration . He is assigned to temporarily take over the duties of the school psychologist  and meets a young man named Eddie Pilikian  to whom he becomes a mentor. The major plotline centers on the Calvin lawsuit, with Superintendent Donna Burke  and school lawyer Al Lewis  attempting to avoid bad publicity associated with the case. To this end, they try to figure out which teachers will \"rock the boat,\" or are critical of the school board policies. Intertwined with the major storyline are Jurel's efforts to reform Pilikian into a student who believes in himself and Jurel's growing moral conundrum that ultimately culminates in a showdown with Dr. Burke, who threatens to fire Jurel if he does not resign. A number of minor plotlines deviate from the primary goings-on. These include Herbert Gower/Stuart Van Ark , an outpatient from a mental institution who is accidentally put in charge of a U.S. History class and makes it fun and engaging; gym teacher Mr. Troy‚Äôs sexual relationship with a student that ends with Jurel taking the girl to an abortion clinic ; and the death of Eddie Pilikian‚Äôs friend Danny , a schizophrenic and kleptomaniac student who is shot and killed by the police after he draws a gun from his locker during a drug search. A romance also begins between Jurel and the attorney Lisa Hammond who at one point strips herself naked in the middle of a hallway. This incident causes Pilikian to pull the fire alarm. While the school is outside, Jurel stands up to Dr. Burke and Vice Principal Rubell saying that he won't resign, and he'll sue them if he gets fired. Jurel then makes a speech about how the whole reason for building the school was for the kids, and how the teachers are supposed to be there for them, which causes the other students to give him an ovation while going back into the building. By the end of the film, Lisa manages to convince Jurel that despite their many flaws, the students of JFKHS are worth risking reputation and career.\n","\n","    ### Response: 1984\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

The rhythmic dissonance of the score and the surprising choreography of the piece result in heckling and outrage among much of the audience. But Chanel is impressed by Stravinsky and his music. Seven years later, Chanel and Stravinsky meet again. Although her business has flourished, Chanel is mourning the death of her lover, Arthur \"Boy\" Capel. Stravinsky has chosen to flee to France following the Russian Revolution. An immediate sympathy and attraction occurs between the ‚Äòcouturiere‚Äô and the composer. Chanel invites Stravinsky to live in her villa outside Paris, along with his ailing wife and their children. The summer months that follow see Chanel and Stravinsky begin an affair, one which Stravinsky's wife can not avoid becoming aware of. Tensions between Stravinsky and his wife, and between Stravinsky's wife and Chanel, are unavoidable. The film implies that the affair, and the later termination of the affair by Chanel, has a major influence on the lives of both Chanel and Stravinsky. It is during this time that Chanel creates Chanel No. 5 with her perfumer, Ernest Beaux, and that Stravinsky begins to compose in a new, more liberated style.

Even more shocking is the sight of the beautiful Francisca, now a selfless nun, nursing the sick at the hospital. Alcantara, the brutal caretaker and Carmen, his unhappy wife, run the place. Shortly after his arrival, Ramallo receives the unwanted visit of Don Eugeni Morel his former boss in smuggling contraband. The well to do middle age Morel, has also sexually abused him for long time. Morel's visit makes Ramallo furious and from then on, he tries to disassociate himself from the crime lord. As a reminder than he can count only on himself, Ramallo gets his own name tattooed on his chest by Alcantara, the hospital's maintenance guy. In the clinic, Manuel has a pet cat that he dotes on. In a fit of anger Ramallo kicks the cat almost to death. Manuel gives the dying animal back to Ramallo to put it out of its misery. They bury the animal together and reconcile remembering their childhood friendship. Ramallo wants to get rid of Morel for good, but his first attempt to steal some money from the church of the sanatorium fails when he is discovered by Francisca. As a child, she had a crush on him and now she is glad to see him again, but assures him that she is perfectly happy in her life as a nun. Ramallo starts scheming to hijack smuggling good from Morel. He recruits Manuel in helping him to steal the keys of Alcantara's car in order to go to the nearby port. In the middle of this dealing, Galindo's death affects Ramallo deeply. Carmen has a soft spot for Manuel and seduces him. At first Manuel tries to resist the temptation because she is a married woman, but she assures him that she is unhappy in her marriage and only feels disgust for her husband. They have sex, but when Manuel finds out that she came to visit him on Ramallo's suggestion, he tells her to leave him alone. Manuel angrily confronts Ramallo accusing him of being jealous of his purity. Ramallo leaves him silent telling him that his anger comes because he is secretly in love with him. In fact attracted to his friend, Manuel steals Ramallo's clothes but, in his morbid religious fervor, fights his desires that he believes are diabolical. Manuel's sexual panic turns into self-inflicted stigmata. Francisca accidentally discovers Ramallo's schemes but does not turn him in, instead she travels with Manuel to recover from the cave in which Pau committed suicide, the items Ramallo stole from Morell. Ramallo escapes the sanatorium and returns to Morel's home. When Morell tells him that Manuel betrayed him, giving away the location of his purloined goods, Ramallo murders Morell with an axe. Ramallo returns to the sanatorium to take revenge on Manuel. Manuel tells Ramallo that he loves him and that he gave the goods to Moreel to fight his attraction for him. Ramallo begins to rape him, claiming that the pleasure will get Manuel torture for the rest of his life. Manuel plunges a knife into Ramallo's throat before slitting his own wrist. Francisca lays out the two bodies in the mortuary and removes her nun's coif.\n","\n","    ### Response: 13\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

The two men, Goro and Yoshi, had brawled earlier that day, and no sooner had they entered the mine then the shaft had quickly flooded. Shigeru Kawamura , head of security at the mine, heads below to investigate. There, he and the local police make a gruesome discovery: Yoshi's lacerated corpse. Above ground, a doctor examines Yoshi, and discovers the cause of death to be a series of deep gashes caused by an abnormally sharp object. As some of the miners comfort Yoshi's wailing wife, the others discuss the possibility of Goro's involvement in the death. The two had never been friends, and had physically fought that morning. Also, Goro was still missing, and could be on the run or still be hiding in the mine. Shigeru warns them not to speak of this until the police investigation begins. Outside, Shigeru meets with his fiance Kiyo , who is also Goro's sister. He comforts her, telling her that he is sure of Goro's innocence. Inside the mine, three policemen stand guard at the edge of the water, knowing if Goro tries to escape, he will surely come that way . Suddenly, they hear a splash in the flooded mine, and venture into the water. As they wade deeper into the shaft, they get more and more nervous. All of a sudden, one of the policemen begins to scream and then disappears under the water. As the men are tied together, is is not to long before another is pulled under by something beneath the surface. The last policeman quickly unties himself and flees. However, before he can escape, he is cornered and attacked by someone, or something. Soon after, his body, along with the bodies of the other two policemen, are brought up and examined. The doctor announces that they, too, were killed by a sharp object that simply sliced them apart. Later that night, the wife of one of the murdered men runs to Kiyo's house and screams threats at her through the door, as she believes that her brother, Goro, is the killer. Shigeru soon arrives and comforts her, telling her that the officers that were killed were Goro's friends, and that he had no reason to kill them. Someone else, then, killed those men. As the two sit together, the answer to the question of who, or what, murdered the men suddenly reveals itself: a gigantic creature, resembling a gigantic insect larva, enters Kiyo's home, and both Kiyo and Shigeru flee. The police enter the home, but the giant insect forces them to flee. When they regroup, they chase the creature to the top of a hill and open fire with machine guns. The monster launches its self down the hillside and grabs two officers, clutching them in its pincers as it flees. It soon drops them and quickly escapes back into the mine. When the police and Shigeru reach the injured officers, they discover that their wounds match the wounds of the murdered policemen and Yoshi. They have found the killer. Soon after, Shigeru and a group of the metro-police head back into the mine to confront the insect monster and attempt to locate Goro, dead or alive. Unfortunately, as they enter the deepest part of the mine shaft, they discover the butchered body of Goro laying on the floor of the mine. As they approach, the giant insect emerges and chases the men back up the mine shaft. Taking action, Shigeru releases the mine cart, which rolls down the shaft and collides with the insect, crushing and killing it. Shigeru and the others then venture back into the shaft and remove Goro's body. They discover a large hole in the wall that opens up into a large cave. They realize that this is the hole through which the water and the giant insect emerged. As they peek through, they are noticed by not just one, but several more giant insects. However, before the monsters can attack, the ground begins to shake, and the mine begins to cave in. Shigeru is trapped in the cave, and the police can do nothing and the mine collapses. The next day, the police investigate the recent happenings. Dr. Kashiwagi identifies the giant insect as a Meganulon, an ancient species of dragonfly larvae that had lived on the Earth millions of years earlier. As the doctor reveals his findings, an earthquake suddenly strikes the area. Rumors begin to circulate that Mt. Aso, the volcano that eclipses Kitamatsu, might be on the verge of an eruption. When the police arrive at the base of the volcano to investigate the damage caused by the earthquake, they are shocked to discover a man wandering around the epicenter. When they reach him, they discover that it is Shigeru. However, he has received a blow to the head and has lost his memory. He is even unable to recognize Kiyo. The doctors are not optimistic about his chances for recovery, but nevertheless do their best to try to help him any way that they can. Several miles away, in Kyushu, an air base receives an alert from one of their jets. The pilot has observed an unidentified flying object performing impossible maneuvers at supersonic speeds. He is ordered to pursue the object at distance, but as he follows it, the object suddenly changes course and turns around. The object then flies straight towards the jet and destroys it. Soon after, reports from all over the world come in about the UFO. The strange object is observed flying over China, Philippines and Japan, and rumors of a secret military weapon test begin to circulate. Back in Japan, a newly married couple disappear, as well as several heads of cattle around Mt. Aso. When the authorities develop the film from the newlyweds' camera, they discover a photograph of what appears to be a gigantic wing. They match the photo with a drawing of a Pteranodon, an ancient reptile thought to be extinct millions of years earlier. Although the evidence seems to point to the Pteranodon as the culprit, the theory is dismissed as being too far fetched. Meanwhile, Shigeru's treatment is progressing slowly, but no one, especially not Kiyo, is giving up. One day, as Shigeru sits silently in his hospital room, Kiyo shows him the eggs that her pet birds have lain. As one of the eggs hatches, a terrible memory returns to Shigeru: Deep within the mine, Shigeru awoke after the cave in. Suddenly, he realized to his horror that he was surrounded by hundreds of Meganulon. The creatures crawled all around the cave, having survived millions of years underground. Shigeru then looked up and was shocked to see what appeared to be a giant egg sitting right in the middle of the cave. Suddenly, the egg began to stir, and then, all of a sudden, it hatched. From out of the fractured shell emerged a gigantic, winged creature with a sharp beak and a head like a bird of prey. Shigeru watched in horror as the enormous hatchling bent over and began to eat the Meganulon. The monstrous insects that had terrorized the town and had killed his friends were now nothing more than a snack to this new creature. With all of the Meganulon gone, the giant monster spread its wings and roared... Shigeru suddenly awakens, his memory restored. As he recovers from seeing the horrifying vision, Kiyo weeps with joy. Shigeru confirms that the creature he saw did indeed resemble a pteranodon, and that it had eaten all of the Meganulon. He and a group of police and scientists once again descend into the mine and enter the cave where the egg had been. They are able to recover a fragment of the shell before a rock slide forces them to flee back to the surface. In the lab, Dr. Kashiwagi is able to determine the size of the egg and its age: 200 million years old. After amassing the evidence, Kashiwagi calls a meeting with members of the town, along with members of the Japanese Self-Defence Force to communicate his findings. He tells the men that the UFO seen flying all across the world at supersonic speeds is a gigantic pteranodon he has dubbed Rodan. The 50 meter tall monster is capable of flying at extremely fast speeds, which create a sonic boom that more than likely led to the destruction of the jet that had first observed Rodan. Kashiwagi still has no explanation as to how the creature could have transversed the globe so quickly, and why reports of sightings occurred in multiple, distant countries at the same time. As to how Rodan could have resurfaced after millions of years is also a mystery, but Kashiwagi theorizes that nuclear bomb testing, which loosened the Earth and opened cavities to long buried crevices and caves, might be the culprit. However, Kashiwagi admits that this is only a guess. Soon after, Rodan emerges from the ground near Mt. Aso, near where the beast had hatched. The creature takes flight and begins to head for Kyushu, with a squadron of the JASDF hot on his tail. They pursue Rodan over the city, and eventually succeed in forcing him into the river. The flying reptile soon emerges, but his flight speed has been cut by half. Rodan flies over the buildings at Fukuoka, and the sonic wave created in its wake literally tears the structures apart. The flying monster lands in the city and flaps its wings, and the entire city is literally pulled down by its own weight. Fires spread, and the JSDF attempt in vain to fight the creature off. The men, and the machines, are simply blown away. Just when it seems things can't get worse, the JSDF reports that another Rodan has been spotted heading towards the city. With the mystery of the spread out sightings now revealed, the second Rodan now flies over and rips apart the buildings. After leveling the city and leaving the remaining buildings in flames, the monsters Rodan fly away, leaving thousands dead. The JSDF formulate a plan to attack the Rodans. After ascertaining their location at their old nest at the base of Mt. Aso, the military plan to shell the volcano and trigger an eruption that will trap the monsters under the lava and rock. However, Kitamatsu will be completely destroyed in the attack, and the town is forced to evacuate. The army prepares for the attack. Just moments before the strike is to begin, Shigeru looks out the window to see Kiyo climbing up the hill. He runs out to meet her, and she tells him that she has come to be with him. Rather than evacuate, she has risked her life to face the danger with the man she loves. The two leave the area and return to safety, and the military begins its attack. They launch rockets and torpedoes at the mountain, and soon the volcano begins to spew smoke and lava into the sky. One of the Rodans emerges, but is soon overcome by the fumes. As the second Rodan arrives on the scene, the first loses altitude and finally falls into the stream of lava flowing down the side of the volcano. The ancient reptile begins to scream in pain as it burns alive in the lava. The military, Dr. Kashiwagi, Shigeru and Kiyo watch from a safe distance as the still flying Rodan watches its companion die in agony. Suddenly, the second Rodan descends and lands with the first in the lava, and it too begins to burn. Rather then live on alone, the creature will die with its companion. Whether they be siblings or mates, the two Rodans lie dying together in the flowing lava. Kiyo buries her head in Shigeru's shoulder and weeps, and both Kashiwagi and Shigeru watch solemnly as the two monsters, each unwilling to live without the other, die together on the slopes of the erupting volcano.\n","\n","    ### Response:  Rodan\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

There are four main story arcs to the film. Three are about the relations of Chow with women that he meets after losing Su Li-Zhen. The first concerns Chow and Wang Jing Wen, the second is about Chow and Bai Ling, and the third is about Chow and a different woman who is also named Su Li-Zhen. The fourth takes place in Chow's mysterious world of 2046 and concerns a Japanese passenger falling in love with an android. Typical of Wong Kar-wai films, the arcs are presented in pieces and in non-chronological order. The approximate order of the arcs is listed below. 2047 arc part I This section is the only part narrated by Chow's fictional character and not Chow himself. Set in the far future, a huge rail network connects the planet. The world is a vast dystopia, and lonely souls all try to reach a mysterious place called 2046 in order to recapture lost loves. In the world of 2046 nothing ever changes, so there is never loss or sadness. No one has ever returned from 2046 except the protagonist, a lonely Japanese man named Tak . As the story begins, Tak is on a long train ride returning from 2046. \"All Memories Are Traces of Tears\" As Chow Mo-Wan's life is revisited, we learn that he is still struggling to get over the loss of his idealised love, Su Li-Zhen. He returns to Hong Kong after being in Singapore for a number of years to try to forget his anguish. To cover up his pain, he becomes a suave ladies' man. Chow attends many lavish parties and beds many women. On Christmas Eve, Chow meets Lulu from the first film  whom he remembers from Singapore, although she has no recollection of him. That night, Chow Mo-wan takes Lulu home as she is quite drunk, but accidentally keeps her room key. As he leaves, he notices that her room number is 2046, the same room number that he and Su Li Zhen had when they conducted their private affair. Upon returning a few days later to return the room key, the landlord informs Chow that the room is not available due to renovations. The landlord offers him the adjacent room 2047. Chow later learns that Lulu was stabbed in the room the night before by a jealous boyfriend. Chow agrees to rent room 2047 in the meantime. After the renovation of room 2046 is complete, the landlord asks Chow if he wants to move in. However, by this time he has gotten used to room 2047 and decides to stay there. The rooms 2046 and 2047 are connected by a common hallway, Chow regularly watches and gets involved with the people that move into 2046. Wang Jing Wen and Wang Jie Wen arc part I The first person that moves next door into 2046 is the landlord's daughter, Wang Jing Wen . Chow spends a good deal of time just observing her from his room. He learns that she has a Japanese boyfriend working in Hong Kong. Unfortunately, the relationship is forbidden by her father. Eventually, Wang breaks up with her boyfriend, then suffers a breakdown and is institutionalised. Afterwards, the next tenant that moves into 2046 is the younger daughter of the landlord, Wang Jie Wen. She is young, attractive, and flirtatious. She frequently tries to seduce him but he refuses each time. A short time later, Chow runs into some financial difficulties, and stops going out. To make some extra money, he starts to write a science fiction series called 2046. The story is set in the distant future, about a group of heart sick individuals looking for love. The only place to find it is at a mysterious location called 2046. Virtually all of the characters in 2046 are based on people that Chow has met, such as Su Li-Zhen, Lulu, or Wang Jing Wen. Whether 2046 is a place, a room, or a state of mind is never explicitly defined. Chow makes the story somewhat bizarre and erotic, and readers seem to take notice. Bai Ling arc part I The third person to move into room 2046 is the coquettish Bai Ling . She wears similar qipao dresses as the original Su Li-Zhen but radiates a much more aggressive sensuality than her. While it is never explicitly stated in the film, it is implied that she is a nightclub girl who occasionally doubles as a high-class prostitute. However, she is intent on finding a long-term relationship. In one instance, when Chow overhears her arguing with a man, Bai tells the man that to continue seeing her, he must end his relationship with the other woman. Chow again spends a lot of time observing her across the thin wall separating rooms 2046 and 2047. On the next Christmas Eve, Bai runs into Chow just after she is dumped by her boyfriend before they are to go to Singapore. Chow suggests that they go for dinner, to which she grudgingly accepts. During dinner, Chow tells Bai about his experiences in Singapore. She is intrigued, and after dinner she agrees to try to form a platonic friendship with him by borrowing time from each other. Their brief friendship does not last however, as they soon develop carnal lust for each other. Not surprisingly, Chow wants to keep the relationship strictly physical; he continues to pick up other prostitutes. To compromise, Bai soon develops a compensation system where he pays her 10 Hong Kong dollars  each time he stays over. However, over time Bai finds that she has feelings for Chow, and she asks him to discontinue seeing other women. Chow refuses and gives a counter offer, the option to be his customer for $10 each night. Bai is crushed and breaks things off with Chow. As a way of revenge, Bai then descends into seeing men exclusively for money, frequently changing partners. A short while later, she moves out of Room 2046. Wang Jing Wen part II After Bai Ling moves out, Wang Jin Wen moves back into 2046 after returning from the mental hospital. She is a shell of a former self, and still very depressed over the loss of her Japanese boyfriend. Her ex writes numerous letters in an attempt to reconcile with her, but she refuses due to her father. Wang passes the time by assisting her father at the hotel. She also starts to spend more and more time with Chow helping him with his writing and editing. At this point, he is regularly publishing chapters of 2046. These scenes are very similar to those in In the Mood for Love when Su Li-Zhen used to help Chow with his writing in their hotel room. Chow remarks that this period in his life is the happiest that he has been after Su Li-Zhen. However, before he realises it, he develops feelings for Wang Jing Wen. He makes some minor attempts to start a romance with her, but nothing develops since she is still very much in love with the Japanese man. One day Wang Jin Wen asks Chow rhetorically if some things in life never change. He answers her by writing a story called 2047. In this story, a Japanese man leaves the world of 2046, but falls in love on the journey home. While he initially tried to base the story on Wang Jing Wen's ex-boyfriend, he realises that the story is ultimately about himself. 2047 arc part II Chow's fictional world is revisited. However, this time it is narrated by Chow himself. Set in the far future, for passengers to reach or leave 2046 they must take a long journey on a vast train network. The main character, Tak  is trying to leave 2046 because he lost the love of his life in that world. As the train travels through the extremely cold sections 1224‚Äì1225, Tak becomes intimate with one of the train's female android assistants  and later falls in love with her. He then asks her numerous times to come with him. However, each time the android does not answer. Tak has heard earlier that excessive operation causes the android's response time to slow down and decides to wait on the train to see if this is the case. He sits quietly on the train, and counts the seconds that go by, hoping the android will decide to leave with him. However, the android still does not respond. Ultimately, Tak realises that it is not a delayed reaction that causes that android not to respond, but that she is in love with someone else and that their relationship is simply not meant to be. With this knowledge, he finally has the strength to leave the train and 2046. Completing the story marks a turning point in Chow's recovery. Wang Jing Wen part III Next Christmas, Chow invites Wang Jing Wen out to dinner. After finding out that she still misses her ex in Japan, he takes her to his office so that she can call him to wish him well. Looking sadly through the window panes as Wang Jing Wen is overjoyed talking to her ex, Chow remarks that in fact Section 1224-1225 from the story are simply the dates for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day when everyone is especially lonely and needs additional love. He goes on to say that while he had feelings for her, and most likely could have taken advantage of the situation  he was happy that in this situation he did the \"right thing\". The call re-ignites the romance. Soon afterward, Wang Jing Wen moves to Japan and gets engaged. A short while later, while still feeling depressed over the loss of Wang Jing Wen, Chow runs into Lulu again as she has a violent confrontation with another woman that is sleeping with her current playboy boyfriend. This incident is identical to one that occurred in the original Days of Being Wild when she confronted the original Su Li-Zhen for sleeping with Yuddy. Chow remarks that Lulu, is likely to forever remain living in the past. However, he then remarks that this is not really a sad thing, as she seems perfectly content to be miserable. The incident strengthens Chow's resolve to get over Su Li-Zhen. Bai Ling arc part II Some time later, Chow gets a call from Bai Ling and the two go out to dinner. This time, Bai looks much less glamorous and more \"run-down\". She informs Chow that she plans to leave for Singapore, and asks him to provide a reference and plane fare. She also asks where he was last Christmas, as she stopped by at that time, and was hoping to see him. In fact, she remarks that she really misses him. It turns out, during last Christmas, Chow had gone back to Singapore in an attempt to find a former lover, another woman named Su Li-Zhen . Su Li-Zhen Arc Chronologically, this arc occurs first in the film. Chow met the second Su Li-Zhen some years back when he first arrived in Singapore. At that time, he was still grieving over losing the original Su Li-Zhen and spending much of his free time in the local casinos. After losing much of his savings, he encounters the second Su Li-Zhen, a mysterious gambler. They become lovers, and he soon wants to know everything about her. But she insists that he beat her in a \"high-card\" draw before she will reveal anything about her past, which he never is able to do. Eventually, she agrees to help him win back his money so that he can return to Hong Kong. When she does so, he prepares to leave, and asks her to go with him. Again, she challenges him to a high-card draw, which he again loses. Knowing little about her, Chow speculates that she, like himself, has a troubled past. Initially heartbroken about this, he remarks that after he completes the story '2047' he finally understands why the second Su Li-Zhen did not go with him, as he would again have tried to recapture the past by looking for elements of the original Su Li-Zhen. When Chow went back to Singapore to visit her the second time, he does not find her. He makes some inquiries as to her whereabouts and speculates that she either returned to Cambodia or was killed. Bai Ling arc part III Shortly after the events of 'Bai Ling arc part II' and the night before she boards a plane for Singapore, Chow again meets Bai Ling for dinner. Bai remarks that, between their two meetings, one of her clients has given her a lot of money and she wants to pay Chow back immediately. He refuses to take the money. Bai insists on paying for dinner, and Chow is stunned when she hands him a stack of money, each $10 bill representing one night they had spent together. Bai tells Chow to pay for dinner with this stack of bills, while unbeknownst to him, she sadly watches behind the restaurant's green window veils. After dinner, Chow walks her back to her apartment. Grasping his hands at the apartment door, she begs him to lend his time to her once more and spend the night. She then asks him \"Why can't it be like it was before?\" He refuses to stay over, even out of pity, coldly stating that that is simply something he would never lend. He exits by jerking his hands away from her and remarks in voiceover that this was the last time he ever saw her. He leaves in a taxi, staring emptily into space, as the camera slowly enters a whispering hole.\n","\n","    ### Response: 2046\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

Later Innocenzi, caught in the \"everybody for himself\" mentality which seems to dominate the landscape, succumbs to the temptation of abandoning his mates to help a sultry black marketeer smuggle a load of flour to Rome, as she needs a driver and does not have room for any other passengers. The deal goes awry due to a mechanical failure in a rubble-strewn town where the famished populace plunders the lorry, and after some recriminations and a brief scuffle, Innocenzi rejoins his companions. They witness the killing of a rookie, a naive Italian soldier who tried to protect a Jewish girl during a German roundup; finally they manage to reach Fornaciari's rural home. The former sergeant is delighted of having returned to his young wife, children and old father and offers Innocenzi and Ceccarelli hospitality for the night; his wife reveals that the family has been hiding a former U.S. POW  who escaped from the Folpiano prison camp to protect him from the fascist militia patrols and Fornaciari, albeit grudgingly, accepts to keep protecting him. After a darkly humorous polenta dinner  they all go to sleep but a nighttime fascist patrol breaks in and manages to find the Allied serviceman. Amidst the children's cries and his wife's weeping, Fornaciari is hauled away toward a grim fate, and Ceccarelli and Innocenzi flee the premises without being able to help. The couple manages to reach Littoria , where Innocenzi's widowed father, , lives alone and offers Ceccarelli  to stay a few days before resuming his travel south. Innocenzi is shocked when his father introduces him to a fascist party leader who is recruiting men for the army of the Repubblica Sociale Italiana, the fascist puppet state instituted by the Germans after the liberation of Benito Mussolini from his Gran Sasso exile. His father angrily responds to his objections, citing the misery he's living in and all the sacrifices he incurred to allow make him to study and become an army officer; a deep rift is created between father and son, and Innocenzi asks Ceccarelli to take him south to Naples as well, to which the engineer happily consents. However Naples is in grimmer conditions than Rome, directly on the line of fire after the Allied landing at Salerno, barely kept under control by brutal German detachments who round up able-bodied men to send them to Germany as slave workers. To reach the city the duo passes through a roadblock manned by fanatical, hungry fascists; Ceccarelli, generously chooses to sacrifice a suitcase of delicacies he was meant to deliver to the wife of his Commanding Officer . The situation  causes Innocenzi much panic, having had raided the case during a night-time train trip and substituting the goods with stones and newspaper sheets; he urges his companion to run away before the fascists open it, but they are unsuccessful. Innocenzi and Ceccarelli are pressed in an Organisation Todt rubble-clearing chain gang and manage to escape when the city insurges against the occupiers in the Four days of Naples. Desperately trying to reach his home, which is just a few blocks away, Ceccarelli is cut down in a hail of German fire, at which time Innocenzi decides that the real war to be waged is that against the Nazi occupiers and joins an insurgent band offering to man the Breda M 37 machine gun they have captured but cannot operate. With a renewed stern look on his face, Innocenzi opens fire against the Germans, bringing the movie to a close.\n","\n","    ### Response: 8 September 1943\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

The owner decides to get Benjamin, the black manager of the club, to talk to Elsie and try to persuade her to cooperate. Benjamin refuses and quits his job. Benjamin tells Elsie of his conversation with the owner and persuades Elsie to stay on because she is popular and can make a lot of money, but he warns her to be careful. Elsie stays, but still refuses to date the customers. Later, the owner hires John and Clyde, Elsie's uncles, to replace Benjamin. One evening, after the club closes, Elsie goes home and finds at her horror that her aunt, who lives with her, is dead. She calls the police and they discover that her aunt has been murdered by a single blow in the head. The police question Elsie and do not believe her story, so they arrest her for the death of her aunt. John and Clyde testify that they saw Elsie on the night of the murder leaving the club for a short time and later returning. Mrs. Green, the sister of Clyde and John, tells the police that Elsie bought a large life insurance policy on her aunt, with herself as the beneficiary. With this evidence, Elsie is convicted of the crime and sent to prison. Benjamin, who has now become a detective on the police force, and Detective Wanzer, who is a close friend of Elsie's, do not believe that she is guilty and set out to find the real killer. After some investigation, they learn that Mrs. Green's husband was actually in love with Elsie's aunt. With jealousy as a possible motive, Benjamin and Wanzer now suspect that Mrs. Green and her two sons are connected with the crime. One night they confront John and accuse him of the murder. John refuses to confess, so Benjamin and Wanzer take him to Tolston's Castle, which is supposed to be haunted. There they threaten to tie him up and leave him at the mercy of the ghosts. Terrified, John decides to tell all. He reveals the story of his sister's family, and tells them how her husband was tricked into marrying her. He told them that Mrs. Green's husband was in love with Elsie's aunt when they lived in the South. The husband, after realizing the trick, ran north, but Mrs. Green pursued him, and her two brothers threatened him to get back together with her. Although he stayed at home after that, Mrs. Green's husband continued to see Elsie's aunt and threatened to leave Mrs. Green. John continues, and admits that he and Clyde lied about seeing Elsie leave the club on the night of the murder. Furthermore, he tells that early in the evening on the night of the murder Mrs. Green found a note left by her husband. The note stated that, out of despair, he had decided to kill Elsie's aunt and then take his own life by jumping off a bridge into the river. John also relates that it was Mrs. Green's plan to frame Elsie for the crime. The police recover Mrs. Green's husband's body from the river, verifying John's story. On this new evidence, Elsie is granted a pardon by the Governor and released from prison. Out of deep gratitude and love, Elsie marries Benjamin, who has been in love with her all the time.Sampson, Henry T.

The conquest largely removed the native  ruling class, replacing it with a foreign, French-speaking monarchy, aristocracy, and clerical hierarchy. The story line monitors the transformation of Thomas Becket, portrayed, following the play, as a Saxon prot√©g√© and facilitator to the carousing King Henry, into a man who continually invokes the \"honor of God\". Henry appoints Becket as Archbishop of Canterbury in order to have a close confidant in this position that he could completely control. Instead, Becket becomes a major thorn in his side in a jurisdictional dispute. Much of the plot concerns Henry, the \"perennial adolescent\" as described by the Bishop of London, who finds his duties as king and his stale arranged marriage to be oppressive. Early in the film, we see him escaping them through drunken forays onto the hunting grounds and local brothels. He is increasingly dependent on Becket, a Saxon commoner, who arranges these debaucheries when he is not busy running Henry's court. This foments great resentment on the part of Henry's Norman noblemen, who distrust and envy this Saxon upstart, as well as the queen and queen mother, who see Becket as an unnatural and unseemly influence upon the royal personage. Henry finds himself in continuous conflict with the elderly Archbishop of Canterbury, who opposes the taxation of Church property in order to support Henry's military campaigns in France . During one of his campaigns in coastal France, he receives word that the old bishop has \"gone to God's bosom\". In a burst of inspiration, Henry exercises his prerogative to pick the next Archbishop and informs an astonished Becket that he is the royal choice. Shortly thereafter, Becket sides with the Church, throwing Henry into a fury. One of the main bones of contention is Thomas' excommunication of Lord Gilbert, one of Henry's most loyal stalwarts, for seizing and ordering the killing of a priest who had been accused of sexual indiscretions with a young girl, before the priest can even be handed over for ecclesiastical trial. Gilbert then refuses to acknowledge his transgressions and seek absolution. The King has a dramatic secret meeting with the Bishop of London in his cathedral . He lays out his plan to remove the troublesome cleric through scandal and innuendo which the position-conscious Bishop of London quickly agrees to . These attempts fall flat when Becket, in full ecclesiastic garb, confronts his accusers outside the rectory and routs them causing Henry to laugh and bitterly note the irony of it all, \"Becket is the only intelligent man in my entire kingdom...and he is against me!\" Becket escapes to France where he encounters the conniving yet sympathetic King Louis . King Louis sees in Becket a means by which he can further his favorite pastime, tormenting the arrogant English. Becket gets to Rome, where he begs the Holy Pontiff to allow him to renounce his position and retire to a monastery as an ordinary priest. The Vatican is a hotbed of intrigue and political jockeying. The Pope reminds Becket that he has an obligation as a matter of principle to return to England and take a stand against civil interference in Church matters. Becket yields to this decision and asks Louis to arrange a meeting with Henry on the beaches at Normandy. Henry asks Becket whether or not he loved him and Becket replied that he loved Henry to the best of his ability. A shaky truce is declared and Becket is allowed to return to England. The remainder of the film shows Henry rapidly sinking into drunken fixation over Becket and his perceived betrayal. The barons worsen his mood by pointing out that Becket has become a folk hero among the vanquished Saxons who are ever restive and resentful of their Norman conquerors. There are comical fights between Henry and his frumpy consort, Eleanor of Aquitaine, his dimwitted son/heir apparent, and his cold-blooded mother, who repeatedly reminds her son that his father would have quickly had someone like Becket done away with for the sake of the realm. During one of his drunken rages he asks \"Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest?\" His faithful barons hear this and proceed quickly to Canterbury, where they put Thomas and his Saxon deputy, Brother John, to the sword. A badly shaken Henry then undergoes a penance by whipping at the hands of Saxon monks. The film concludes with Henry, fresh from his whipping, publicly proclaiming Thomas Becket a saint and that the ones who had killed him will be justly punished.\n","\n","    ### Response:  Becket\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

One sees the true relationships of the family as the story comes together, Grace waits at the bed of Jordan Walker, the man driving the truck which collided with Bennett's car in the crash. She is waiting for his wake so she can ask him what her son's final 17 minutes were. After a while, she finds out the truth but is disappointed in what she hears. In the last moments, Bennett was not calling his mothers name, he was calling to Rose asking the other wounded passenger Walker to make sure that she was safe. Allen hires a cleaner to clean the house, but when Grace finds out she is terribly angry, claiming their son has been washed away. Allen then appears to be having a heart attack whilst Grace carries on shouting until she realises what the matter is. At the hospital bed, shortly after Grace returns from finding out the truth about Bennett, Allen breaks down crying claiming to be holding in all his grief and upset, he claims he could have done something to prevent the crash and later his son's death. Rose, meanwhile, has overheard Grace saying she should have died and not Bennett and so she leaves and seeks the help of her mother. She soon realises that all her mother is bothered about was trying to get money from the Brewers, claiming it will help her. The Brewers try to find Rose and they find her in labour and persuade her to go to the hospital and, while in the car on the way, she demands to know everything about Bennett she did not already know. When the film draws to a close, one sees Rose and the baby, a girl called Ruby, Grace's favourite girl's name.

Before he dies, Gavin utters the word \"Christopher.\" Later, Holmes and Watson go to the Limehouse district of London, where they meet with Gavin's wife Kitty . Holmes tells the council that, through the use of an oscilloscope to carefully analyze and compare sound wave patterns from radio broadcasts of live vs. pre-recorded voices, he has determined that \"The Voice of Terror\" is actually recorded on phonograph records in England, but broadcast from Germany. Using a tip from Kitty, Holmes and Watson go to the old Christopher Docks, where they are followed by Sir Anthony Lloyd  of the council. The three men are captured by a group of Nazi spies led by a man named Meade , although Meade manages to escape through a trap door to a waiting speedboat. Kitty pretends to be a thief on the run and joins Meade. She finds out that Meade plans to go to Sir Evan's country estate that night. There Holmes and Sir Evan watch a German plane attempt to land, but gunshots fired by Sir Evan disrupt the Nazi rendezvous, all the while Meade hides in the dark. After one of Holmes informants traces Meade and Kitty to the south coast of England, Holmes forces the council to go there with him. With the support of British troopers, Holmes captures Meade and a group of German soldiers stationed in an abandoned church. There he reveals the true identity of \"The Voice of Terror\" as Sir Evan Barham, who happens to be an impostor. Holmes then reveals that in World War I, the real Barham was a prisoner in a German war camp and had an uncanny resemblance to a Heinrich Von Bork, a member of the German Secret Service; one day the real Barham was taken out executed; the gentleman who called Holmes into the case was Von Bork himself who had posing as Barham for 24 years; Holmes then adds that Barham had no immediate family, so his private life was well studied by Von Bork, who also studied at Oxford and had knowledge of the English language and manners. So, with a little help of plastic surgery, not to mention the resemblance to Barham in the first place, the deception was carried out thoroughly. Holmes also concludes that the real Sir Evan Barham carried a scar from childhood, the one Von Bork carried from plastic surgery was approximately 20 years old - the clue that gave away the fact that he was an impostor. Holmes then informs the spies that the German invasion force has been destroyed. The angry Meade shoots and fatally wounds Kitty, but is killed himself as he attempts to escape. The Council stand around the murdered Kitty and swear that her heroic death will not be in vain. The film ends with a direct quote from \"His Last Bow\": :Watson: It's a lovely morning, Holmes. :Holmes: There's an East wind coming, Watson. :Watson: I don't think so. Looks like another warm day. :Holmes: Good old Watson. The one fixed point in a changing age. But there's an East wind coming all the same. Such a wind as never blew on England yet. It will be cold and bitter, Watson, and a good many of us may wither before its blast. But it's God's own wind none the less. And a greener, better, stronger land will be in the sunshine when the wind is cleared.Davies, David Stuart, Holmes of the Movies  ISBN 450 03358 9\n","\n","    ### Response:  Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

She works at Rio de Janeiro's Central Station, writing letters for illiterate customers, in order to make ends meet. She can be impatient with her customers and sometimes does not mail the letters she writes, putting them in a drawer or even tearing them up. Josu√© is a poor 9-year-old boy who has never met his father, but hopes to do so. His mother sends letters to his father through Dora, saying that she hopes to reunite with him soon, but when she is killed in a bus accident just outside the train station, the boy is left homeless. Dora takes him in and traffics him to a corrupt couple, but she is made to feel guilty by her neighbor and friend Irene and later steals him back. Dora is initially reluctant to be responsible for the boy, but ends up deciding to take a trip with him to Northeast Brazil in order to find his father's house and leave him there. Dora tries to leave Josu√© on the bus, but he follows her, forgetting his backpack containing Dora's money. Penniless, they are picked up by a kind, Evangelical truck driver who abandons them when Dora encourages him to drink beer and then grows too friendly. Dora trades her watch for a ride to Bom Jesus on the back of a truck. They find his father's address in Bom Jesus, but the current residents say that Jesus won a house in the lottery, and now lives in the new settlements, adding that he lost the house and money through drinking. With no money, Josu√© saves them from destitution by suggesting Dora write letters for the pilgrims who have arrived in Bom Jesus for a massive pilgrimage. This time she posts the letters. They take the bus to the settlements, but when they locate the address they have for Josu√©'s father, they are told by the new residents that he no longer lives there and has disappeared. Josu√© tells Dora that he will wait for him, but Dora invites him to live with her. She calls Irene in Rio and asks her to sell her refrigerator, sofa and television. She says that she will call when she gets settled somewhere. After she hangs up, she learns that there are no buses leaving until the next morning. Isa√≠as, one of Josu√©'s half-brothers, is working on a roof next to the bus stop, and learns that they are looking for his father. After introducing himself, Dora says that she is a friend of his father and was in the area. Isa√≠as insists that she and Josu√©, who, suspicious of the stranger, has introduced himself as Geraldo, come to dinner. They return to his house, where they meet Mois√©s, the other half-brother. Later, Isa√≠as explains to Dora that their father married Ana, who he doesn't know is Josu√©'s mother, after their mother died, and that nine years ago, while pregnant, Ana left her drunken lover for Rio and never returned. Isa√≠as asks Dora to read a letter his father wrote to Ana when he disappeared, six months ago, in case she returned. In the letter, the boys' father explains that he has gone to Rio to find Ana and the son he has never met. He promises to return, asks her to wait for him, and says they can all be together -- himself, Ana, Isa√≠as and Mois√©s. At this point Dora pauses, looks at Josu√© and says, \"and Josu√©, whom I can't wait to meet.\" Isa√≠as and Josu√© both say that he will return, but Mois√©s doesn't think so. The next morning, while the sons sleep, Dora sneaks out to catch the bus for Rio. She first leaves beside the letter from Jesus the one from Ana to Jesus, the one Dora carried with her from the Central Station but never mailed, expressing Ana's wish for the family to be reunited. Josu√© wakes up too late to prevent her departure. Dora writes a letter to Josu√© on the bus.

Pilot Bill Brooks , co-pilot Joe , and steward Larry  comprise the crew. A fierce nighttime storm buffets their airliner. A gas cylinder comes loose and is thrown against the door, forcing it open; Larry falls out to his death. An engine fails and the pilots are forced to crash-land in the jungle. In the morning, the professor recognizes the plants of the Amazon rainforest. The aircraft has been blown far south of where rescuers would search, and the nearest civilization is across the mountains; but there is water where they are, and enough fruit and game to live on. Weeks go by while Bill and Joe struggle to repair the damaged aircraft, and the others clear a runway. The experience changes everyone. The Spenglers rediscover their love for each other. Bill warms to an appreciative Peggy, although she tells him about her past. Judson goes to pieces, staying drunk much of the time, while Alice toughens up, and begins to feel attracted to Joe. The biggest change is in Vasquez. Seeing how well most of the group have coped with their situation, he reconsiders his radical beliefs. On the 23rd day, Crimp disappears. It is Tommy who eventually discovers him. When Peggy and Pete go looking for the boy, he leads them to the body, which has a poison dart in it. Pete orders Peggy to take Tommy to safety while he covers their retreat, and is also killed by the unseen natives. The remaining survivors board the now-repaired aircraft, but as the engines rev up, an oil leak develops. Bill and Joe patch it, but realize that it will fail some time after takeoff, leaving only one working engine. As a result, the aircraft can only carry four adults and Tommy across the mountains. As everyone tries to decide how to choose who will stay and who will face the hostile natives, Vasquez suddenly grabs a gun and announces that, since he is doomed no matter what, he is the only one without bias and will make the decisions. He will think about it until the plane is ready. While thinking, he is approached by Professor Spengler, who says he and his wife have lived their lives and should stay, and by Judson, who tries to bribe Vasquez by offering to pay for a top lawyer. When the aircraft is ready, Vasquez announces that both pilots and both of the younger women will go along with Tommy. Judson attacks him and Vasquez shoots him dead. The aircraft takes off, leaving Vasquez and the Spenglers. As the natives approach, Professor Spengler quietly informs Vasquez that must not be taken alive, as they will be tortured. Vasquez lies to him, telling him that there are three bullets left. He kills the couple with his last two bullets, and waits for his grisly fate.\n","\n","    ### Response: 12 Hours to Kill\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

Other members of the commune include Johnny Red, a '60s radical who constantly refers to Sweden as an ideal society; Gin, Red's hippie girlfriend; Karla, a bisexual with issues of misandry; Sweeny, a promiscuous DJ who worked at a local record store; Double D , an unintelligent but good hearted commune member, and Puck's best friend; and \"The Trolls,\" a ragtag group of \"crunchy types\" who lived in tents in the backyard of the house and home schooled about a dozen children. The commune, referred to as \"Sam,\" is funded by a collective Anarchist bookstore, where the members take turns operating the front desk. Throughout the movie this group is referred to as \"The Family,\" and their way of life is described as peaceful and happy, until the day Johnny Black, a mysterious, militant nihilist with a forceful personality, appears. Johnny Black shares much of the rebellious philosophy of \"the family\" when he shows up, however he disrespects what he sees as the narrow minded and shortsighted protest tactics Johnny Red espouses. However, politically weak within the framework of the Family, Black cannot challenge Red's authority for the time being. Frustrated and unhappy with his social life and lack of direction, Puck seeks a girlfriend. He eventually meets a young woman at a night club, Jody, who he learns is a young Republican college student. However, when his new observations of Jody's political beliefs and academic success causes him greater internal conflict and personal embarrassment, Puck decides to temporarily leave the Family and ventures out to find a new job and home. Still unhappy and directionless, Puck opts to return to the Family.  In the time that has transpired in Puck's absence, Black's influence over the family has steadily grown. Encouraging the group to forge alliances with \"like-minded\" organizations. Over time, Black undergoes a more militant shift in personality. At a meeting for a planned protest demonstration against a petrochemical plant, Black denounces the peaceful, non-violent approach most of the attendants support, and presents two tools to be used in their attack on the plant: semtex and The Anarchist Cookbook. Johnny Red describes the book as \"a relic from the past... it taught you how to make bombs, how to make drugs... and it meant something once.\" He also accurately mentions that the author, William Powell, has disavowed the book. He continues, commenting, \"the book's not the problem. The problem is the kind of people who look to it for answers.\" A few days afterward, Johnny Black discovers Red's private journal, in which he admits to being sexually attracted to young boys. He places this in the open for Gin to discover, and after reading a passage in which Red admits to his pedophilia, she dumps him. Following this, Red's personality becomes more anxious and submissive to Black. One day, while carrying science kits, Puck, Double D, and Sweeney are approached by a police officer who randomly stops them and requests to inspect their contents. After complying, they receive a ride from the officer to Sam, explaining that their run down house is in fact an orphanage the kits are intended for. The officer decides to visit the building, and enters to discover Karla in the midst of using cocaine with Johnny Black. The entire group, except for Johnny Red, is promptly arrested and brought to trial, the presiding judge ironically being a spurned, former lover of Karla. The flop house, Sam, is shut down by the city; Johnny Black receives time at a medium security prison, with the possibility for parole in four months; Sweeney and Double D each receive 250 hours of community service; Karla, aside from being insulted by the judge, is made to receive a mandatory psychiatric evaluation; and Puck is placed under house arrest for 180 days, and forced to move into his parent's home in the city of Plano, Texas. Puck chafes in his suburban life, but comes to accept it with Jody's encouragement, until Johnny Black is paroled after four months. Black appears in Puck's apartment and easily convinces Puck to remove the ankle bracelet that tracks him and rejoin the Family.  Puck soon discovers that Karla, Sweeney, and Double D are all suffering from drug addiction, and have relocated to a new squat which they name \"Son of Sam\". The next stage of Johnny Black's strategy for his movement is the creation of a coalition of organizations which agree with any facet of his goals. However, these include extremist, conservative groups, such as neo-nazis and militia men. Black offers The Anarchist Cookbook as an instructional booklet to the other groups, while they pledge to offer various arms and explosives, and plans a \"joint mission\" to attack a local university. Puck attempts to leave the organization, but is under constant surveillance. He commits to remaining in the group, so as to watch over Double D, for whom he feels responsible. This situation eventually ends in tragedy when Double D overdoses on diazepam. Puck finally resolves to escape from the group and prevent the mission, and convinces a sober Sweeney and Johnny Red to help. Together, they devise a plan to intoxicate the extremist group members with pancakes laced with the very drugs Double D overdosed on. Once the entire organization is unconscious, the surviving members of the Family split up. Alone, Puck decides that once the group awakens he'd be in immediate danger, and so decides to report the organization and cooperate fully with the FBI, for which he receives a reward of $200,000. Immediately afterward, Puck considers his options and realizing that he now has the money and time to commit to his future, decides to take Jody's advice and return to college. Alone, he begins to hitchhike to California to join Jody as she interns at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. Receiving a ride from a truck driver, Puck is asked what his name is, and after some internal thinking, decides to accept his legal name and chosen name together: \"Peter Puck.\" The final monologue by Puck meditates over his new perspective on life and his personal philosophy, and renounces the concept of \"freedom without responsibility,\" which contrasts with his idealistic opening-sequence monologue.\n","\n","    ### Response: 100 Proof\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

Each Marine is not only experienced but has a special skill with the exception of the radio operator, PFC Grenier . Grenier, an air crew radioman with only six months in the Corps is taken off the PBY's air crew when the original radio operator suddenly became medically unfit for the mission. He is given the sick Marine's radio and camouflage jacket to carry on his first ground combat mission. He serves as a narrator to the audience. After meeting up with their guide , the patrol commander Captain Alonzo Davis  is killed while ambushing a small group of Japanese soldiers, and First Sergeant Corey  takes command. Pvt. George George and Pfc. Henry Reynolds are killed while taking out a Japanese tank and patrol. And Cpl. Stanley Parrish is killed by a guerrilla trap soon after. As they walk on, Amado is shot by a Japanese officer while scaling a small hill. The marines let him die to keep their presence secret. Grenier is eventually told by Gunnery Sergeant Wartell  that they were sent to recover some important information from a contact in a tea house whose radio was destroyed, thus explaining the radio's importance to the mission. Grenier's inexperience and incompetence arouses anger amongst Corey and the other members of the patrol. His only friend is easy going but professional Gunnery Sergeant Wartell who acts as a mediator between the hard no nonsense 1st Sgt Corey and Grenier, explaining each one to the other and the audience. Rooney provides the only comedy relief in the film when his character is captured and interrogated by a group of careless Japanese soldiers. The surviving squad members eventually arrive at the tea house but, unfortunately, Amado was the one who was supposed to meet the contact as he was the only Filipino in the group. Desperate, the group sends Corey to met the contact, Miyazaki a Filipino-American woman from Long Beach, California. While sneaking out of the camp with Miyazaki, Corey crashes into a waiter and the two run across a straw bridge then blow it up with a grenade, escaping from the soldiers. Meanwhile, a large skirmish with a Japanese patrol has killed Cpl. Alvin Ross and Platoon Sergeant William Maccone, shot the radio up beyond repair, and wounded Gunnery Sergeant Wartell. Wartell, knowing he will slow the survivors down, tells the reluctant Corey to leave him behind. When they leave, he plants grenades under himself and is captured by the Japanese soldiers. After toying with them a bit during his interrogation he sets off the grenades, taking them all out in the blast, and leaving Corey and Grenier the only surviving marines. The explosion is heard by the survivors and they sadly track on. Corey and Grenier learn from Miyazaki that the Japanese are expecting the invasion fleet and have placed a mine field powerful enough to destroy the entire fleet in the water around the invasion sites. Arriving at a friendly Filipino village, Corey and Grenier are able to escape a Japanese patrol by boat. But Miyazaki is killed by an officer she seduced to buy the guys some time.

Coe is found dead the next morning in his bedroom, locked from the inside. District Attorney Markham , Police Sergeant Heath  and everyone else assume it was suicide since he was shot through the head and was found holding a pistol. However, Vance is not convinced. He soon finds evidence that shows that Coe was murdered. Coroner Dr. Doremus  determines the victim died of a stab wound. There is no shortage of suspects; Coe was very much disliked. His niece Hilda Lake  resented her uncle's tight control of her finances and jealousy of any men who showed interest in her. Her boyfriend, Sir Thomas MacDonald , suspected Coe of killing his dog to ensure winning the competition. Raymond Wrede , the dead man's secretary, was in love with Miss Lake, but had been laughed at when he sought Coe's support. Coe's next door neighbor and lover Doris Delafield  had been cheating on him with Eduardo Grassi . When Coe found out, he canceled a contract to sell his collection of Chinese artworks to the Milan museum for which Grassi worked. Liang , the cook, had worked long, hard and illegally to help Coe amass his collection. He warned his employer against the proposed sale and was fired as a result. Even Coe's own brother Brisbane ([[Frank Conroy  made it clear that he despised him. Finally Gamble , the head servant, had concealed his criminal past. Brisbane Coe becomes Vance's prime suspect. His alibi of taking a train at the time of the murder is disproved. However, when he is found dead in a closet, Vance is both puzzled and enlightened. Among Brisbane's effects, Vance finds a book titled Unsolved Murders; a bookmarked page details a method of using string to lock a door through the keyhole without leaving a trace. Part of the mystery is solved. Later, an attempt is made on the life of Sir Thomas using the same dagger used to kill Coe. Finally, a Doberman Pinscher belonging to Miss Delafield is found seriously injured, apparently struck with a fireside poker. From these and other clues, Vance finally solves the crime. It turns out that two men had sought Coe's life that night. The successful murderer had struggled with Coe, stabbed him, and left him apparently dead. However, Coe awakened soon after. Too dazed to recall the fight and notice that he was mortally wounded, he went upstairs to his bedroom and opened his window before dying. Brisbane entered the chamber, saw his brother apparently asleep in his chair. He shot the corpse and arranged the scene to look like a suicide. However, downstairs he ran into the actual killer, who had seen that Archer Coe was still alive and came back to finish the job. In the darkness, he mistook Brisbane for Archer and killed the wrong man. Delafield's dog then wandered in, attracted by the commotion, and attacked the murderer. While sure of the killer's identity, Vance has no proof. He therefore arranges for Sir Thomas and Wrede to quarrel over Hilda Lake. When Wrede instinctively reaches for the poker to strike his rival, the healed Doberman which Vance had brought recognizes its attacker and leaps on him. Wrede confesses he became enraged when Coe refused to assist his courtship of Miss Lake, precipitating the initial stabbing.\n","\n","    ### Response: 6.12\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

They both have a very low opinion of the opposite sex, and staunchly believe marriage is not the way to go for the two newlyweds, whom they try to discourage from proceeding further. Simrita convinces Kamini to test out her theory that men are after only one thing, by forcing Lucky to delay their marriage vows for three months. She is sure, Lucky will not be able to do so and this will prove to Kamini that Lucky is just another low-class male, like all others, and her claims of him being different than most men are unfounded. Viraj, upon hearing about this new development, tries to do the exact opposite. This results in a hilarious scene at a local disco bar, where Viraj lures Kamini with the hope of her finding Lucky with a \"girlfriend\" that he has planted in the lap of Lucky in order to make Kamini jealous. The plan backfires and Kamini and Lucky end up in divorce court where the judge puts them on a three month probation and marriage counselling. Meanwhile, Simrita and Viraj keep bumping into each other when they both travel to Italy independently; the former to make some quick cash as a model to pay for her medical bills, and the latter, with Lucky, to chill out and take a vacation from all of the marital stress Lucky has been facing back home. Upon returning home, Simrita is given a watch pendant by her Dolly Aunty  to wear as a good luck charm. The pendant hangs from a bracelet on her wrist. Viraj gets seriously hurt in an accident at work and is brought for emergency surgery to the hospital where Simrita is an intern. Much to each other's irritation, Simrita is given the charge to perform surgery on Viraj. After the surgery, while looking at the X-rays, she is horrified to discover that the watch on her wrist has accidentally ended up in Viraj's stomach. Simrita tries various ways of getting the watch out. During one such process, which fails, it becomes clear that Simrita is bitter about her perceived unfaithfulness of the two most prominent men from her childhood: her divorced father and her elder sister's ex-husband. By this time, Viraj is secretly beginning to fall in love with Simrita. Several days later, Simrita is successful in removing the watch from Viraj's stomach. Following the surgery, Viraj overhears the truth and leaves. Several days later, he proposes to Denise Richards in an attempt to forget about Simrita. Upon realizing her mistake, Simrita helps Lucky and Kamini reconcile and decides to confess her love for Viraj at the wedding ceremony. At first, Denise is upset but then tells Viraj to go to Simrita.

Kama is one of the six moral weaknesses: kama , krodha , lobha , moha , madha  and matsara . Jayanthi, who somehow manages to carry herself despite being a little too well-fed, begins with a song expressing pangs of separation with her soldier-husband. The song -- 'Viraha,' is a classic in Kannada movie lore, and is quite often interjected in banter to express estrangement. As the song ends with the return of her husband, it becomes evident that the war has not just crippled his leg. Subsequently, the trauma of a marriage bereft of a physical relationship is portrayed in sing-song histrionics prevalent in movies of this period. The introduction of the brash, loud, motorbike-riding Nanjunda, infuses enthusiasm into a hitherto hurried and jarring narrative. Nanjunda, a fresh college graduate, also happens to be the Captain's neighbor. A word on topography and co-ordinates is in order here. The movie appears to be depicting Kodagu  as inferred by the frequently portrayed undulating hills, and typical Kodava dresses. The Captain and Nanjunda, own adjoining estates in this region. Nanjunda is on a visit, and seems to indulge in little but bike-riding and indolence. His dad's estate is managed by his uncle, Shivaram, another stentorian voice that strains the eardrums. The next part is the heart of the movie where Kanagal shines through with his trademark symbolism and narrative restraint. Many sequences are edited to be suggestive but incomplete, leaving just enough room to make it imaginative, but not enough to make vague. Nanjunda and the couple  move from being well-acquainted to being cosy friends through card-games and raucous, if unnecessary, laughter. And then it happens. Madhavi and Nanjunda embark on a picnic to Edakallu gudda , a desolate hilltop that houses a cavern, and has a little pond in it to boot. Though merely playful to begin with, proximity and solitude combine to tempt them, and Madhavi, in a moment of weakness falls prey to lust. If Nanjunds seduced her has no objective answer. Kanagal's subsequent portrayal of the uneasy relationship between Nanjunda and Madhavi deserves merit for its transitional nature. Nanjunda's infatuation in the immediate aftermath of the their first corporeal encounter, Madhavi's tortured complaisance in furthering the passion, till a fog of guilt and doom descends on her, are excellent in injecting a dash of reality. As the confused relationship teeters, a twist arrives in the form of Devaki, Madhavi's sister who arrives to stay with her sister. Nanjunda is immediately enamoured, and switched allegiance in a trice. But Devaki proves a harder nut to crack, and his advances are spurned with minimal effort. As a hapless onlooker to this courtship, Madhavi's welling emotions brimmeth over, adding anger and betrayal to guilt and remorse. Meanwhile, Nanjunda achieves a breakthrough as he machinates a picnic to, where else‚ÄîEdakallu gudda, with Devaki. He isn't as lucky this time. As Nanjunda gets more desperate in wooing Devaki, and Madhavi gets even more desperate in protecting her sister, things come to a head. The cat is let out of the bag in the form of too audible a meow emanating from Nanjunda's bedroom -- that Madhavi creates and  Devaki overhears. An interspersed song with the two sisters as muses, is pleasant for its departure from being a typical male-female duet. The climax is best left to the viewer.\n","\n","    ### Response: 999\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

Jesuit missionaries are trying to encourage the local Algonquin Indians to embrace Christianity, with thus far only limited results. Samuel de Champlain, founder of the settlement, sends Father LaForgue, a young Jesuit priest, to find a distant Catholic mission in a Huron village. LaForgue is accompanied on his journey by a non-Jesuit assistant, Daniel, and a group of Algonquin Indians whom Champlain has ordered to guide him to the Huron village. This group includes Chomina  - an older, experienced traveller who has clairvoyant dreams; his wife ; and Annuka , their daughter. As they journey across the lakes and forests, Daniel and Annuka fall in love, to the discomfort of the celibate LaForgue. The group meet with a band of Montagnais Indians who have never met Frenchmen before. The Montagnais shaman is suspicious  of LaForgue's influence over the Algonquins. He accuses him of being a devil. He encourages Chomina and the other Algonquins to abandon the two Frenchmen and travel instead to a winter hunting lodge. This they do, paddling away from the Frenchmen. LaForgue accepts his fate, but Daniel is determined to stay with Annuka and follows the Indians as they march across the forest. When one Indian tries to shoot Daniel, Chomina is consumed by guilt at having betrayed Champlain's trust. He and a few other members of the Algonquin tribe return with Daniel to try to find LaForgue. As they recover LaForgue, a party of Iroquois attacks them, killing Chomina's wife and taking the rest captive. They are taken to an Iroquois fortress, where they are beaten and told they will be slowly tortured to death, only after Chomina's young son is killed before his eyes. Annuka helps them escape by seducing a guard with sex. Chomina, dying of a wound from his capture, freezes to death in the snow; LaForgue tries, unsuccessfully, to persuade Chomina to embrace Christ before he dies. When Chomina dies, he sees the She-Manitou appearing to him. Annuka and Daniel take LaForgue to the outskirts of the Huron settlement, but leave him to enter it alone, because Chomina had dreamed that this must happen. LaForgue finds all but one of the French inhabitants dead, murdered by the Hurons who blamed them for a smallpox epidemic. The leader of the last survivors tells LaForgue that the Hurons are dying, and he should offer to save them by baptizing them. LaForgue confronts the Hurons. When their leader asks LaForgue if he loves them, LaForgue thinks of the faces of all the Indians he has met on his journey, and answers \"Yes\". The leader then asks him to baptize them, and the Hurons accept Christianity. The film ends with a golden sunrise. An intertitle explains that fifteen years later, the Huron were massacred by the Iroquois, and the French mission was destroyed.\n","\n","    ### Response: 1492: Conquest of Paradise\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

Even though Tigress and Mantis are annoyed at the deception, Po engages their interest in the story of the trio of masters first met. Long ago in the city of Jinzhao, Rhino , Ox  and Croc  are small-time pit fighters who attracted the attention of Grand Master Oogway , who, seeing their talent and focus, wished them to find something worthy to fight for. As the trio fought themselves to a standstill, two of the villainous Wu Sisters were freeing their leader and eldest sister Su Wu . To recapture them, Oogway persuades Rhino, Ox and Croc into helping him find the sisters at Hubei Volcano. However, to his disappointment, Oogway has to appeal to them with vague prospects of being put on a path to riches to get that cooperation. While the Wu Sisters plot to unite the various criminal gangs to seize control of China, Master Oogway has to brush off each of his compatriot's petty proposals during the journey to abandon the others for their benefit. At camp, Oogway eventually discovers that while Croc and Ox are motivated by narcissism and greed respectively, Rhino has a deep-seated need to win his dad Master Flying Rhino's  respect.

The film shows the story of a bereaved Queen Victoria  and her relationship with a Scottish servant, John Brown , and the subsequent uproar it provoked. Brown had been a trusted servant of Victoria's then deceased and beloved Prince Consort, Prince Albert; Victoria's chief servants thought Brown might help to ease an inconsolable Queen since the Prince Consort's death in 1861. In 1863, hoping to subtly coax the Queen toward resuming public life after years of seclusion, Mr. Brown is summoned to court. The plan succeeds a little too well for the servants' liking, especially Victoria's chief secretary Sir Henry Ponsonby (played by [[Geoffrey Palmer  and The Prince of Wales  as well as other members of the Royal family; the public, press and politicians soon come to resent Brown's perceived influence over the queen. Brown takes considerable liberties with court protocol, especially by addressing Her Majesty as \"woman\". He also quickly takes control over the Queen's daily activities, further aggravating the tensions between himself and the royal family and servants. The moniker \"Mrs. Brown\", used both at the time and in the film, implied an improper, and perhaps sexual, relationship. The film does not directly address the contemporary suspicions that the Queen and Brown had had a sexual relationship and perhaps had even secretly married (see the article on [[John Brown , though cartoons from the satirical magazine Punch are shown as being passed around in Parliament . As a result of Victoria's virtual recluse, especially at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, something initially encouraged by Brown, her popularity is failing and there is a growing rise in republican sentiment. Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli  has a weakening hold over the House of Commons and a fear of rising anti-monarchical sentiment in the country. He persuades Brown to use his influence with the Queen and persuade her to return to the performance of her public duties, especially the speech from the throne at the impending opening of Parliament. Brown is reluctant to do so, rightly fearing that Victoria will take this as a personal betrayal. When Brown urges Victoria to return to London and fulfill her public duties, an argument ensues. Feeling betrayed by Brown, the Queen becomes enraged. She can't believe what she is hearing. When Brown once again refers to her as \"woman\", she sharply rebukes him. Leaving the room, she turns to Ponsonby and Jenner requesting that they serve her needs, clearly reducing Mr. Brown's contact and influence over her. Their relationship was never to be the same again. The Queen's eventual acquiescence and her decision to return to public life eventually leads to a revitalization of her popularity and a resurgence in public support of the monarchy. Brown continues to serve Queen Victoria, until his death in 1883. In his final years, his duties become reduced to head of security. The palace staff has become weary of Brown's dogmatic ways and they mock and rebuke his security efforts as paranoid delusions. Finally, during a public event, a gun wielding assassin appears out of the crowd leaping toward the royal family. An ever vigilant Mr. Brown successfully thwarts the assassination attempt. At dinner the next evening, the Prince of Wales retells the story, bragging to their dinner companions that he had been the one to warn Brown of the assassin. Seeing through her son's bragging, the Queen announces instead that a special medal for bravery, the \"Devoted Service Medal,\" will be minted and awarded to Mr. Brown. Some years later, Mr. Brown becomes gravely ill with pneumonia after chasing through the woods late at night searching for a possible intruder. Hearing of Brown's illness, the Queen visits Mr. Brown's room and is visibly shaken to see her old friend so ill. Placing a cool damp cloth against Brown's fevered brow, she confesses that she has not been as good a friend as she might have been in recent years. It is clear that her apology is accepted by Brown. The pneumonia proves fatal for Brown and he passes away. During his years of service, Mr. Brown has kept a diary and upon his passing, Ponsonby and Dr. Jenner discuss its contents stating that it must never be seen by anyone. Holding the diary at his side, Ponsonby walks away and it's implied that the diary will be destroyed or will disappear. Dr. Jenner also reveals that the Prince of Wales has hurled the Queen's favorite bust of Mr. Brown up and over the \"palace wall\", referring us back to the film's opening sequence. The film's closing crawl informs us that: \"John Brown's diary was never found.\"\n","\n","    ### Response:  Mrs. Brown\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

Lieutenant Alexis Rosanoff  of the Imperial Russian Air Force lands in Paris after a dangerous flight over enemy territory, bringing important dispatches from Russia. He persuades his superior, General Serge Shubin , to take him to see Mata Hari perform that night. Rosanoff is instantly smitten by her . By youthful exuberance and good looks, he persuades her to spend the night with him. However, the next morning, she makes it clear to him that it was a one-time dalliance. Carlotta  secretly instructs Mata Hari to report to Andriani , their spymaster. Andriani orders her to find out from General Shubin the contents of the dispatches Rosanoff brought.

Furious, Shubin telephones Dubois and confirms that Mata Hari is a spy. She shoots him dead before he can carry through on his threat to implicate Rosanoff.

When he wins a lot of money cheating at craps, he has to be rescued from a robbery attempt by a complete stranger, Ballin Mundson . Mundson tells him about an illegal high-class casino, but warns him not to practice his skills there. Farrell ignores his advice, cheats at blackjack, and is taken by two men to see the casino's owner, who turns out to be Mundson. Farrell talks Mundson into hiring him and quickly gains his confidence. However, the unimpressed washroom attendant, Uncle Pio , keeps calling him \"peasant\". One day, Mundson returns from a trip with a beautiful and spirited new wife, Gilda . It is immediately apparent that Johnny and Gilda have a history together, though both deny it when Mundson questions them. Johnny visits Gilda alone in the bedroom she shares with her husband, and the two have an explosive confrontation that elucidates both their past romantic relationship, which ended badly, and their love-hate dynamic. While it is unclear just how much Mundson knows of Gilda and Johnny's past relationship, he appears to be in ignorance when he assigns Farrell to keep an eye on Gilda. Johnny and Gilda are both consumed with their hatred of each other, as Gilda cavorts with men at all hours in increasingly more blatant efforts to enrage Johnny, and he grows more abusive and spiteful in his treatment of her. Meanwhile, Mundson is visited by two German businessmen. Their secret organization had financed a tungsten cartel, with everything put in Mundson's name to hide their connection to it. However, when they decide it is safe to take over, Mundson refuses to transfer ownership to his backers. The Argentine secret police are interested in the Germans; government agent Obregon  introduces himself to Farrell to try to obtain information, but the American knows nothing about that aspect of Mundson's operations. When the Germans return later, Mundson shoots and kills one of them. That same night, at Mundson's house, Farrell and Gilda have another hostile confrontation, which begins with them angrily declaring their hate for each other, and ends with them passionately kissing. Mundson arrives at that moment, then flees to a waiting airplane. Farrell and Obregon witness its short flight; the plane explodes shortly after takeoff and plummets into the ocean. However, Mundson has parachuted to safety, thus faking his death. With Mundson apparently dead, Gilda inherits his estate. Gilda and Johnny marry, but while Gilda married him for love, Johnny has married her to punish them both for their mutual betrayal of Mundson. He stays away, but has her guarded day and night out of contempt for her and loyalty to Mundson. Gilda tries to escape the tortured marriage a number of times , but Johnny is ultimately able to thwart every attempt, determined to keep her trapped in the relationship that has become a prison for them both. Finally, Obregon tells Farrell that Gilda was never truly unfaithful to Mundson or to him, prompting Farrell to try to reconcile with her. At that moment, Mundson reappears, armed with a gun. He faked his death to deceive the Nazis. Mundson tells them he will have to kill them both, but Uncle Pio manages to fatally stab him in the back. Obregon shows up, and Johnny tries to take the blame for the murder. Uncle Pio finally credits Johnny for being a true gentleman, while insisting that he had killed Mundson. Obregon reminds them both that Mundson had technically died years before, but there is also such a thing as justifiable homicide. Farrell gives Obregon the incriminating documents from Mundson's safe, and the police confiscate the estate for the government. Farrell and Gilda finally reconcile and confess their mutual love, and apologize for the many emotional wounds they have inflicted on each another.\n","\n","    ### Response:  Gilda\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

After she sings the first verse of \"Five O'Clock Whistle\" in the opening to establish this fact, Bugs pops out of her basket to ask where she's going. She replies that she's going to \"bring a little bunny rabbit to my grandma's. Ta HAVE, see?\" With this part of the story set up, the wolf is now introduced. The wolf switches a \"Shortcut to Grandma's\" sign, so that Red has to go through a long mountain path, while the wolf uses the real shortcut ‚Äì a few short steps to the house. Seeing a note on the door that Grandma isn't home , the wolf sneaks inside and dresses like grandma ‚Äì only to find that a bunch of other wolves are similarly dressed and waiting in the bed for Red! The wolf  growls for the others to \"COME ON! COME ON! take a powder ‚Äì this is MY racket!\" and the other wolves leave muttering to themselves, and a small wolf leaves from under the pillow. Once in bed, the wolf waits for Red to come to the door. But in a twist the wolf isn't interested in eating Red, but rather the rabbit she brought with her. The wolf quickly shuffles Red out the door and tries looking for Bugs. Bugs, however, gets the better of the wolf and runs around the house, being 'chased' by the wolf. Along the way, Bugs subjects the wolf to the famous lots-of-doors in-and-out routine . The wolf, however, is constantly interrupted by Red, who continues asking the questions from the story, such as \"That's an awfully big nose for you ‚Äì ta HAVE.\" Towards the end of the cartoon,the wolf finally corners bugs but Bugs imitates the wolf's every action even when the wolf keeps telling Bugs to stop. After eluding the wolf by distracting him into singing, \"Put On Your Old Gray Bonnet \", Bugs manages to get a glowing coal from the fireplace and sends the wolf to the ceiling by scorching his backside. When the wolf comes down, Bugs has a large shovelful of coals waiting to scorch the wolf. However, the wolf manages to catch his feet on the ends of two benches just in time, doing the \"splits\", facing the camera. Instead of simply kicking one of the benches away, Bugs proceeds to dump heavy weights into the wolf's arms. After clearing out just about everything in the house , Bugs is about to apply the coup de grace on the wolf ‚Äì by placing an olive branch on top of the mass of junk and furniture the wolf is holding ‚Äì when Red comes back in, bellowing \"Hey, GRANDMA!\"  By this time, even Bugs has had enough of Red's interruptions, prompting him to say, \"I'll do it, but I'll probably hate myself in the morning.\" He descends the ladder, out of frame, there's a shuffling of the furniture... and now RED is the one desperately trying to avoid getting scorched , while Bugs and the wolf, arms around each other's shoulders, share a carrot and self-satisfied looks, and await the inevitable.\n","\n","    ### Response:  Little Red Riding Rabbit\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

I remember this 90's low budget R movie, I think the main character falls for his (very blond) co star in the crime reenactments that are made for TV. I think at the end she sets him up to be the actual criminal who is known to break into women house's and hides in the closet waiting to attacks them. It was a late night movie on HBO (or maybe Showtime/Cinemax) so it had Nudity but not excessive, so its most likely an erotic thriller and I do remember it having a sex scene in a (blue?) public bathroom stall at some point. Feel like it might have been a rip off of basic instinct, would have been early 90's though, maybe like 93ish (but maybe earlier too). Description of the main actors (to the best of my memory). Male Lead: darks hair, olive skin tone in my memory, but he doesn't pop out to me as someone I would know from other films. Female Lead: I thought the woman might have been Shannon Tweed, but I could not find it under her films, as she did similar types of movies (though I think the women in this was almost platinum blond if memory serves)\n","\n","    ### Response: 69 Degrees of Separation\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

He chases him back to the servant quarters which are like, a bunch of cots in a row with a ton of other servants sleeping in them. The servant boy lays down in his cot and pretends to be asleep, and the king comes down and starts to lean down and listen to all the servant’s hearts while they’re sleeping to see who’s heart is beating the fastest from running to find out which boy was kissing his daughter.

Also the setting was possibly British (or northeastern US?) and the vibe was peculiarly conservative in its portrayal of dating and marriage.

The only part I saw of this movie was that there were two little boys and a woman. I think the boys were brothers and one was a few years older than the other. The younger one was probably 4 or 5 maybe. The boys tied up the woman to a chair. I don't believe this woman was their mom, but maybe it could be a gf of their dad or maybe their stepmom? That detail I'm not sure about, but the way they were treating her made it seem that way. The older boy was being mean to the woman but the younger boy was trying to get the woman a glass of water or something. On the way over to the woman, the youngest boy falls down and lands on the drinking glass, breaking it into pieces. The pieces of glass go into the boys chest or abdomen. The woman then starts begging the older boy to let her go so that she could take his brother to the hospital.

The police officer investigating it talks to the husband, and implies that he suspects the woman is faking it. The husband is talking to a friend about it, and says he didn't like the police officer's implication, but then says he supposes it's his job to look at it from all angles. Later, the woman says the man is calling her, and everyone including the husband thinks she's hallucinating it, I think it's because the phone was disconnected or something like that, and she's sent to a psychiatric hospital. Then it turns out the husband was somehow behind it all, and he was planning to kill her, but I don't remember any other details. I think there's also a subplot, but I don't remember it.

Just after the parents received the bad news, they walked outside the doctor's office through a hallway. They were walking slowly towards the camera, and the camera was walking backwards. The wife was holding his husband's arm tightly, as if she was feeling that she was gonna faint. Again, formal clothes. I guess this is towards the end of the film. The mom decided to read a book for his son while he was paralytic in bed, not being able to move any single muscle. She started reading and reading but he remained motionless. But then, I don't remember if he blinked or moved his chin, the point is that the kid responded to his mom reading the book. That gave her hope that his son is still aware, so she continued to read.

She says that in the movie a young boy moved to a building where a girl had died after falling from the top of the stairs in the building. He decided to investigate her death and found out that what really happened was that she had jumped from the top so that her mother/nanny could catch her, but missed and she died. My friend also adds that the boy moved to the building to be with his uncle, who had a room full of taxidermy animals and the boy could not come inside. The animal's eyes were really diamonds, and those where important in the plot for solving some mystery or something.    I can't remember if she mentioned anything else, but these were the main points. She is not sure if the movie is Spanish (we are from Spain) or not, so maybe it was not really popular in other countries.    Maybe this description is not of one movie but two or more!

I liked the movie enough to want to remember it and wrote it down, sadly that paper was lost years ago.    Anyways, I believe it to be British made film in where a man dealing with trauma has created inside himself the idea and narrative he is a superhero (who is actually currently in cell block CTscan if ya catch my drift), with this belief we see the man overlay his idea of how just he is being in his actions by being given the vivid imagery of a dystopian cityscape and him believing to be the antihero everyone is beckoning for. Multiple scenes of what seem a muted color and cool action stealth transpire. He has a nemesis throughout these “visions” however it is not immediately anthropomorphized in the storyline or plot. Alongside this bag of marbles doing his thing, people are living separately from his plot line, however, showing their struggles and problems. (More) normal people continue to thread together until the ending, where the escapee (superhero) tries to kill his father (nemesis) from a rooftop overlooking a restaurant where his father and said normies are dining. The whole thing is basically is an outcry to the simplest and farthest reaches of issues when it comes to mental health and their resolution.    I don’t know it’s name.

Michiel feels resentment towards his father, the mayor, who is seemingly only interested in maintaining the status quo between the town and the German Army. He worships his Uncle Ben, an adventurer in contact with the local resistance. During the winter, Michiel's loyalties are tested. An allied plane is hit in the air and crashes, but before it hits the ground, a young British airman is able to escape by parachute. One of the villagers, Dirk, helps the airman, Jack, but Dirk is arrested. Before his arrest, Dirk gives Michiel a letter to be delivered to Bertus, the village blacksmith. Before Michiel can deliver the letter, Bertus is shot and killed by the Germans. Michiel opens the letter, which directs him to Jack's hiding place in the forest. Jack is injured, and Michiel enlists the aid of his sister Erica, a nurse, to take care of him. Jack and Erica soon develop a romantic relationship. Michiel's father is arrested when the body of a German soldier, killed by Jack on the night of the plane crash, is found in the forest. Jack wants to turn himself in to save Michiel's father, but Ben tells Michiel he can save his father. Ben's efforts fail, and Michiel's father is shot by the Germans. Michiel ties to take Jack to the town of Zwolle, across a river, but the Germans foil their attempt, and the two narrowly escape after a chase through the forest. Michiel finally turns to his Uncle Ben for help in getting Jack to Zwolle. Ben agrees, and Ben, Jack and Erica set off for the bridge to Zwolle. As they leave, Ben tells Michiel that Dirk should never have gotten Michiel involved with Jack. After they go, Michiel realizes that he had never mentioned Dirk's role to Ben. Quickly checking Ben's suitcase, he finds papers showing that Ben is working for the Germans. Rushing to the river, Michiel stops the trio, grabs Jack's pistol, and confronts Ben. While Michiel guards Ben, Jack and Erica succeed in making it across the river to Zwolle. Ben tells Michiel that he had arranged for his father to be released, but that his father refused to let another villager be shot in his place. Ben attempts to escape to a passing German patrol, but Michiel shoots and kills him. A few months later, Allied soldiers enter the village and are rapturously welcomed by the villagers. One of the soldiers brings a letter for Erica, presumably from Jack. Michiel hesitates to join in the celebrations after all that has happened, but finally joins in.\n","\n","    ### Response: 1945\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

Whether it is communal bias, social bias, economic bias, religious bias or educational bias, the \"bias\" factor dominates the entire depiction of the film, merging different characters into one story. The different biases that are incorporated into the film are as following: #Religious bias - A devout Muslim listens to the radical sermons of a religious leader that aims to instigate his followers to take revenge for the wrongdoings occurring within the Islamic community. This leads his followers to collaborate to create havoc in the city, but plans fail. However, when the plan is about to succeed, the follower decides to abort it, seeing a Hindu boy walk towards it. This child had previously helped a lost Muslim girl find her mother. #Communal bias - Rajpal Yadav is a Bihari who has just arrived in Mumbai, looking for work. In his quest for some money and food, Yadav encounters incredible bias against his community, with Marathis blaming his creed for taking away jobs and others ridiculing his sub-par technical skills. On the other side, a Brahmin politician opposes his son's courtship of a Dalit girl; however, he decides to exploit the relationship for political gain. #Social bias - Sarika is the administrator of a large hospital, running it with zeal and fervor. Seema Biswas is a poor woman who is trying to gather funds for her husband's bail money, as he has been framed in a fraudulent case. Biswas works at Sarika's house, cooking meals and cleaning the house. Despite Seema's honest work, Sarika continues to doubt her when things go missing, checking her purse and doubting her character. In the end, it is Biswas who comes to the aid of Sarika at a crucial moment. #Gender bias - Sarika's husband is a successful builder and owner of several Call Centre across Mumbai. Intoxicated with money and power, he finds himself unable to resist deflowering women, using every moment to lure women, by showering expensive gifts on them. However, a moment arrives where he finds himself on crossroads, unable to face the reality, but understanding its repercussions. #Economic bias - Perizaad Zorabian is a successful creative head of a channel. However, work and life has tensed her. She is unable to bear the hectic pressure of Mumbai and asks her husband to find work in either the United States or United Kingdom. Perizaad looks for opportunities to insult people and finds her financial power too strong to succumb to emotion. Biases of these sort weave the entire story into finding resolutions based on the biases of individuals and the reality of the lifestyle of Mumbai. The message clearly floated through movie is We have to learn to live together like Brothers or perish like Fools, as said by M. Luther King. This movie plot has certain similarities with the plot of Crash , an American movie starring Matt Dillon, Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Thandie Newton and Brendan Fraser.{{cite news}}\n","\n","    ### Response: 2009\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

This idea was thought up by a TV producer named Cynthia . They interview Ed Pekurny  and his brother, Ray . When the producers see the interview Cynthia decides to use Ed and interviews only Ed. So now they start airing the show, which they call Ed TV. The show is a total failure at first, as only boring things happen and the main producers want to pull the plug, except for Cynthia. However, Ed TV suddenly gets interesting on Day 3 when Ed visits Ray. Ed  discovers that Ray is cheating on his girlfriend Shari . Ed then visits Shari to apologize to her for Ray's actions. Shari is very drunk and starts insulting Ray, by talking to the camera. She makes everyone laugh and gasp by saying \"Ray was a bad lay.\" Ed tries to comfort Shari, and he reveals he has feelings for her. She then reveals she has feelings for Ed as well. They slowly move their faces closer and finally kiss each other. Ed then locks out the camera crew and proceeds to passionately kiss Shari for a while. Ed TV suddenly becomes extremely popular. Ed then goes on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and meets beautiful model/actress Jill  who takes a liking to Ed. Ed then visits Shari and she tells Ed that she does not want to be with him until the Show stops airing. She then leaves town. Ed goes to the park with Ray and some friends to play football when Jill comes to talk to him, because Cynthia brought her in to earn more ratings. She invites Ed to dinner at her house. When he arrives at Jill's house, there is a massive crowd. They have a small talk, and then they kiss on top of a table. They are about to have sex, but then Ed falls off the table and squishes Jill's cat. Ed never sees Jill again. Ed's father , who abandoned his family when Ed was 13, unexpectedly visits Ed and informs him that he left because Ed's mother was having an affair with Ed's current stepfather, Al . Ed is furious with his mother and argues with her. Next, Ed gets a phone call telling him to come to the hospital. The doctor says that his father is dead and that he died making love to his wife. Ed thinks this means Al, but it actually is his real father and that Ed's mother was cheating on Al. After the funeral, Ed becomes disheartened by the fact that the producers want him to stay on longer and that he cannot do anything to change their minds or he would be in breach of his contract.

When Ed exits, one camera man stays with Shari saying that it is the producers' new idea. The main camera man tells him that all his family are being filmed, but they show the most interesting person.

As the Sultan leaves, the trail of a burrowing rabbit crosses the desert towards the cave. Hassan spots the burrow tunneling under the entrance of the cave and attempts to chase out the intruders, but has trouble remembering the command to open the door. Inside the cave, Bugs Bunny and his traveling companion Daffy Duck emerge from the burrow, believing they have arrived at Pismo Beach. Daffy's complaints are silenced when he spots the riches. Determined to keep it all for himself he stomps repeatedly on Bugs to force him back into the burrow. Meanwhile Hassan finally says the correct command to open the door and marches in. He is met by Daffy, who is wheeling a cart full of loot. Daffy asks him to call a cab. In response, Hassan brings his sword down on Daffy's head, splitting in half both the diamond-adorned hat he is wearing and a single feather underneath. Daffy flees in terror and uses a large gem to try bribing Bugs into saving him, but Bugs is only concerned with dusting himself off from the earlier abuse from Daffy. Hassan rushes towards them both, sword raised. Daffy hides and tells Hassan to chop the rabbit, but Bugs has disguised himself to be a genie in a bottle and fools Hassan with a rich offer for releasing him. Hassan does, taking no notice of Daffy's attempt to expose Bugs. Bugs tells Hassan the treasure is his to claim. Daffy sardonically mocks Bugs for allowing Hassan access to the treasure he wanted for himself. Outside the cave, Bugs surveys the desert and concludes he is in the wrong place. Suddenly Daffy runs out carrying a large gem, with the enraged Hassan in hot pursuit. Daffy begs Bugs to save him, and this time Bugs reluctantly complies while berating Daffy for his greed. He sets up an Indian rope trick behind a rock, and misleads Hassan up the rope. As Hassan disappears into the clouds, Bugs pulls the rope down. With the coast clear, Daffy runs back to the cave to claim the treasure. Some time later, Daffy has emptied the cave of treasure into an enormous cart. Looking back, he spots an old oil lamp and rubs the dust off it. A genie emerges from the lamp, but Daffy thinks the genie is after the treasure and proceeds to stomp him back into the lamp. The furious genie erupts from the lamp, declaring Daffy will suffer the 'consequences' and Bugs, unable  to save Daffy now, hurriedly escapes via burrow.

Chronologically, the order would be: *The Second Renaissance - a prequel set generations before the original film, The Matrix, relating how humans built artificially intelligent Machines, the apocalyptic war between the two, ending with the Machines enslaving the human race and the initial creation of The Matrix virtual reality. *A Detective Story - a stand-alone story in which the character Trinity appears, but independently of any other characters. Because Trinity is present it takes place at least within several years of the films, and though it is not made clear within the cartoon if it takes place before or after Trinity met Neo in the original film, another official source places it before the events of The Matrix.Matrix Universe poster, included in Enter the Matrix: Official Strategy Guide, Bradygames, 2003. *Kid's Story - set during the six month gap between the events of the first and second films, after Neo joins the crew of the Nebuchadnezzar in freeing other humans from the Matrix. Its events are briefly alluded to in dialogue at the beginning of The Matrix Reloaded. *Final Flight of the Osiris - takes place directly before The Matrix Reloaded, as the hovercraft Osiris stumbles upon the Sentinel army digging to Zion. At the beginning of The Matrix Reloaded, Niobe mentions that their reconnaissance photos of the Machine army were transmitted from the Osiris. The other four shorts  are independent of the events of any other installment. While they generically deal with the virtual reality of the Matrix, and the Zion rebels, conceivably they could take place at any point in the generations-long struggle between the human rebels and the Machines running the Matrix. Like the Matrix trilogy, the entire movie except The Final Flight of the Osiris was rated R by the MPAA mainly for its Sci-Fi violence. When it was released on DVD, it was unrated.  The Second Renaissance is a two-part film written and directed by Mahiro Maeda. He used Bits and Pieces of Information written by the The Wachowskis as a prequel to the series as a base for the first part. With increasing numbers of people released from all labor, the human population has become lazy, arrogant, and corrupt. Despite this, the machines were content with serving humanity and, as the narrator states, \"for a time, it [the status quo] was good\". This phrase is a reference to one of the most famous phrases of Genesis, consistent with the Biblical references seen throughout the original Matrix films, and is one of numerous references to Genesis in particular present in \"Second Renaissance\". The relationship between humans and machines changes in the year 2090, when a domestic android is threatened by its owner. The android, named B1-66ER in what appears to be a reference to the character Bigger Thomas from the novel Native Son, then kills the owner, his pets, and a mechanic instructed to deactivate the robot. This murder is the first incident of an artificially intelligent machine killing a human. B1-66ER is arrested and put on trial, but justifies the crime as self-defense, stating that it \"simply did not want to die\". During the trial scene, there is a voice-over of Clarence Darrow  quoting a famous line from the Dred Scott v. Sandford case in 1856 in his closing statement, which implicitly ruled that African Americans were not entitled to citizenship under United States law. Using this as a precedent, the prosecution argues that machines are not entitled to the same rights as human beings, and specifically that human beings have a right to destroy their property, while the defense urges the listener not to repeat history, and to judge B1-66ER as a human and not a machine . {{quote}} B1-66ER loses the court case and is destroyed. Across the industrialized world, mass civil disturbances erupt when robots and their human sympathizers rise in protest. World leaders fear a robot rebellion, and governments across the planet initiate a major program to destroy all humanoid machines. News reports show rioting in American and Western European cities such as Chicago and Berlin, alongside the peaceful \"Million Machine March\" on the Albany district courthouse where B1-66ER was sentenced. Visual references are made to such incidents as General Nguy·ªÖn Ng·ªçc Loan's execution of Viet Cong officer Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn L√©m, the Tank Man standoff following the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, the Al-Aqsa Intifada and The Holocaust. Some robots escape destruction when humans, in their greed, still want the robots to work and produce things for them. The machine population is exiled, and they create their own nation in the Middle East, named Zero One . According to the narrator, the robots built Zero One in \"the cradle of human civilization\", an allusion to the Fertile Crescent, apparently located in Saudi Arabia's \"Empty Quarter\" which is devoid of human life. Essentially ghettoized at Zero One, the machines establish their own industrial base there and begin to produce efficient, highly advanced artificial intelligence, echoing Vernor Vinge's thoughts on a technological singularity. The new nation excels at manufacturing high-tech consumer products, and before long, Zero One's consistent export of cheap, reliable, mass-produced goods begin to undercut the global economy. The United Nations Security Council calls an emergency economic summit at UN headquarters in New York City, resulting in UN delegates approving of a global economic blockade of Zero One that echoes the Cuban Missile Crisis. Two robotic ambassadors, built as a mechanical Adam and Eve, are sent by the leaders of Zero One to peacefully request the admission of their state to the United Nations as a prelude to settling the economic crisis peacefully. Despite their peaceful intentions, the ambassadors are forcibly removed from the chamber, and their application is rejected. As this scene unfolds, the narrator states that \"this was not the last time the machines would take the floor there\" foreshadowing the end of Part II. Part I ends as the Security Council debates the issue of short-sightedly declaring war on the Machine Empire.  Part II opens with United Nations aircraft unleashing a massive nuclear bombardment on Zero One. The nuclear carpet bombing devastates the machine city, but is unsuccessful in destroying many elements of the mechanical population, given that the machines did not have the same weaknesses to the bombs' fallout and heat as humans. The machines retaliate by unleashing their armies to conquer neighboring human countries, triggering a world war between the United Nations and Zero One. Unfortunately, most of the world's industrial output is already based in Zero One, as the lazy humans had grown accustomed to not producing things for themselves. Despite their best efforts, human troops are unable to hold back Zero One's relentlessly efficient onslaught, and slowly retreat . As the machine forces push deeper across the planet, military leaders begin to pursue increasingly desperate solutions. At a summit of political and military leaders from around the world, unanimous approval is given to a plan code-named \"Operation Dark Storm\", which aims to cut the machines off from the sun, their primary energy source. The plan is executed in 2095, with high altitude bombers dispersing sky-darkening nanomachines into the air, while the human armies simultaneously launch a ground offensive against the machine forces. The plan is initially successful, although many of the human nations' long-range weapons systems are also disabled by the lack of sunlight. With their high-tech weapons rendered useless, human commanders are forced to launch close-quarters infantry engagements, supported by electromagnetic artillery fire and armored assaults using atomic tanks and powered armor. Heavy losses are taken on both sides, but the Machines gradually gain the upper hand. Legions of a new model of machine, no longer in humanoid form and appearing more like the insectoid or cephalopod-like Sentinels and others of the Matrix films, overrun the human armies. This coincides with the destruction of original man-made robots at the hands of human forces and, as a result, the further dehumanization of the rapidly emerging machine collective. As the machine armies swarm across the human defenses, the United Nations, in desperation, fires nuclear missiles directly at the machine armies, vaporizing their own troops in the process. To make up for the lack of solar power, the machines begin capturing human prisoners and using their bodies to power large biomechanical tanks, which quickly cut through the dwindling human artillery. As the expanding armies of Zero One overrun Eurasia, they unleash lethal biological weapons which further ravage humanity. Eventually brought to its knees by the might of the machine army, the Security Council calls a global summit at U.N. headquarters to sign an armistice and end the war. Zero One's machine ambassador signs the peace treaty with a barcode, in which the humans agree to surrender their remaining territories to the machines. \"Your flesh is a relic, a mere vessel. Hand over your flesh and a new world awaits you. We demand it\" are the only words the machine utters before it detonates a nuclear bomb in the meeting chamber, killing most of the planet's leaders and destroying New York City, one of the few remaining human settlements. In 2102, the machines crush the leaderless remnants of the human armies, and the war ends. Zero One is victorious, but it is a Pyrrhic victory: the planet has been devastated by the war and by the crippling ecological impact of the Dark Storm shroud, which the machines are unable to remove. In need of a new energy source, the machines adapt their bioelectric tank technology to build vast human-stocked power stations, using their bodies' waste-energy to catalyze a powerful fusion reaction, in which in its making the Humans endure many days of agonising torture, and at its completion, the Machines create the computer-generated virtual reality of the Matrix , to keep their prisoners sedated by feeding the virtual world into the prisoners' brains, starting with the first prototype Matrix .  Kid's Story was written by the The Wachowskis and directed by Shinichiro Watanabe, with animations by Kazuto Nakazawa and production design by Studio 4¬∞C, Tokyo. It is the only one of the animated shorts contained in The Animatrix in which Neo appears. The short takes place during the six month gap between The Matrix and The Matrix: Reloaded, during which time Neo has joined the crew of the Nebuchadnezzar and is helping the rebels to free other humans from the Matrix. Kid  is a disaffected teenager who feels there is something wrong with the world, frequenting hacker chatrooms on the internet and wondering if he is alone. In school, he absent-mindendly scribbles \"Neo lives\" in his notebook. One day he receives a personal invitation from Neo  to escape the Matrix . The following day, he receives a call from Neo on his cell phone, and is chased through his high school by a band of Agents, before ultimately being cornered on the roof. He asserts his faith in Neo, and throws himself from the roof, whereupon the other characters are shown holding his funeral. The short fades up from black as the Kid awakens in the real world to see Neo and Trinity watching over him. They remark that he has achieved \"self substantiation\" , which was considered impossible. In both the short itself and The Matrix Reloaded, however, the Kid seems to believe it was Neo's actions, not his own, that saved him. Self-substantiation is never thoroughly discussed in any part of the series. Morpheus speaks of the founder of Zion who freed himself, presumably without external help. However, this was revealed to be a ruse by the machines. Kid's Story and World Record both heavily hint at this as the viewer wonders how a man being awoken from one of those pods, apparently helpless, could somehow build and start a city.  Program was written and directed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri. The character designs were done by Yutaka Minowa. In case with Beyond and Matriculated it is also a midquel of the first or second film. It follows the protagonist, \"Cis\" , who is engaged in her \"favorite simulation\": a battle program set in feudal Japan. After successfully eliminating an attacking enemy cavalry, a lone samurai appears whom Cis recognizes as \"Duo\" . \"Cis\" made her first appearance as an image in The Matrix Revisited. Initially, the two duel as allies, testing one another's fighting abilities. During the course of their duel, Duo briefly disarms Cis. He questions her concentration and wonders whether she regrets taking the Red Pill that took them out of the \"peaceful life of the virtual world\". They continue fighting until she finally overpowers Duo and is poised for the 'kill'. It is at this point that Duo states that he has \"something to say\". She sarcastically assumes that he wants to propose [marriage]; but instead he admits a desire to return to the Matrix; incredulous, Cis nevertheless responds that doing so is impossible as 'the truth' is already known to them, forbidding their re-integration. Duo reasons that reality is harsh and that he is tired of it. He adds that the Machines can make the both of them forget the truth. Duo then states that he has disabled or killed the other crewmembers and contacted the Machines. He asks Cis to return with him to the Matrix, but she continues to refuse. As Duo becomes more aggressive in his arguments for returning, Cis attempts to escape while simultaneously warding off his attacks. Becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the situation, Cis requests an operator in order to exit the simulation. Duo tells her that no one can hear her and reiterates that it \"is already done...[the machines] are on their way\". Thereafter their fighting becomes much more serious and forceful as they move from rooftop to rooftop. Duo, in a flying leap, attacks her from above with his sword. As the blade comes towards her, Cis, standing her ground, concentrates and halts its forward motion inches from her face and breaks it. She takes the broken end of the blade and thrusts it into Duo. Duo states his love for her as he dies. Suddenly, she wakes from the program and discovers that the encounter with Duo was a test program devised for training purposes. A man named \"Kaiser\"  unsuccessfully assures her that she acted appropriately during the test and met the test's targets. Clearly upset, she punches him in the face and walks away. He remarks that \"aside from that last part\", she passed the test.  World Record was created by Madhouse and directed by Takeshi Koike, with a screenplay by Yoshiaki Kawajiri and is also a midquel of the first or second film. The beginning of this short includes a short narration from the Instructor  explaining details behind the discovery of the Matrix by \"plugged-in\" humans. Only exceptional humans tend to become aware of the Matrix, who have \"a rare degree of intuition, sensitivity, and a questioning nature\", all qualities which are used to identify inconsistencies in the Matrix. This is not without exceptions, given that \"Some attain this wisdom through wholly different means.\" The story is about Dan Davis, a track athlete, who's competing in the 100m in the Summer Olympic Games. He has set a world record time of 8.99 seconds, but his subsequent gold medal was revoked for drug use. He decides to compete again and break his own record to \"prove them wrong.\" Despite support from his father and a young reporter, Dan's trainer tells him that he is physically unfit to race and that pushing himself too hard will cause a career ending injury. Dan is adamant on racing. On the day of the race, he is monitored by 4 agents located in the stadium. The race begins and Dan starts off strong. However, the muscles in his leg violently rupture, putting him at a setback and scaring many of the people in the stands. Through strong willpower, Dan ignores the injury and runs much faster than he did before, easily passing the other athletes. Before he can cross the finish line, 3 of the agents possess the 3 closest runners and try and stop him, but even they can't catch up to him. Dan's massive burst of energy in the Matrix causes his real-world counterpart  to rip apart the plug connecting him to the Matrix, causing him to see the real world through his pod. A Sentinel restrains him back in his pod and violently shocks him with electrified restraints. Dan's mind is thrown back into the Matrix, but his body is exhausted from the race and what he has just seen, causing him to tumble to the ground at high speeds. Despite this, Dan easily won the race and broke his original time of 8.99 seconds with a time of 8.72 seconds. The next scene shows a crippled Dan being wheeled by a nurse through a hospital. A nearby agent calls his other agents to tell them that they erased Dan's memory of the race and that he will never walk again; he won't be an issue. However, Dan quietly whispers the word, \"Free,\" angering the agent and telling him to sit back down. Davis then breaks free of the restraints in his wheelchair and takes a few steps before falling down again and being helped up by the nurse.  Beyond is written and directed by Koji Morimoto. It is a midquel short film, during the first or second installment of the trilogy. It follows a teenage girl, Yoko , looking for her cat Yuki. While asking around the neighborhood, indicatively somewhere in Japan, she meets some younger boys. One of them tells her Yuki is inside a \"haunted house\" and invites her to see it. The children have stumbled across an amalgamation of anomalies within an old, dilapidated building. They have learned to exploit this glitch in the Matrix for their own enjoyment, through several areas which seem to defy real-world physics: glass bottles reassemble after being shattered, rain falls from a sunny sky, broken lightbulbs flicker briefly , a door which opens into an endless dark void, shadows which do not align with their physical origins, and a dove's feather that rotates rapidly in place in mid-air. There is a large open space in the middle of the run-down building where they take turns jumping off a high point and falling towards the ground, yet somehow stopping inches before impact. This proves amusing and they do not seem to be bothered by the inherent strangeness of the place. Throughout the film, brief sequences show that Agents are aware of the problem in the Matrix, and a truck is seen driving toward the site to presumably deal with the problem. It arrives while the children are still playing, and an Agent-led team of \"rodent exterminators\" moves in to clear everybody out of it. The story ends when Yoko and the others return to the area the next day and find the site has been turned into an unremarkable parking lot. They unsuccessfully attempt to re-create the bizarre occurrences of yesterday and soon go in search of something else to do.  A Detective Story is written and directed by Shinichiro Watanabe, with animation by Kazuto Nakazawa and is a direct prequel to the first film. It follows the story of a down-on-his-luck private detective, Ash , on what he calls the \"case to end all cases\". Ash receives an anonymous phone call to search for a hacker that goes by the alias \"Trinity\" . Ash traces Trinity and learns that other detectives have failed in the same task before him; one had committed suicide, one had gone missing, and one had gone insane. He then attempts to speak with the insane detective but cannot get anything substantial out of him. This detective is an African American with a thin mustache who shows a resemblance to Walter Mosley's detective character 'Ezekiel \"Easy\" Rawlins'. This is a possible homage to the character as Mosley's detective series is set in a similar Noir type setting and there were not many black detectives at the time. Eventually Ash finds Trinity after deducing that he should communicate using phrases and facts from Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. She proposes a meeting, and he successfully finds the location. At the meeting she removes a \"bug\" from his eye, planted by Agents earlier in an \"eye exam dream\". Agents appear and attempt to apprehend Trinity in a shoot-out with her and Ash. While the two fugitives are trying to escape the train, an Agent attempts to take over Ash's body, forcing Trinity to shoot him in order to prevent the Agent from appearing. Ash is wounded, whereupon he and Trinity bid farewells without malice. Trinity escapes, telling Ash that she thinks he could have handled the truth. Agents enter the car to find Ash, who points his gun at them while looking in the other direction and lighting a cigarette. The Agents turn to Ash who, even though he is armed, will likely die. With this apparent no-win situation, the film ends with Ash's line  as his lighter flame goes out.Easy Rawlins  {{Redirect}} Matriculated was written and directed by Korean American director Peter Chung, widely known for his work on Aeon Flux. Like Beyond, it is a midquel of the first or second film. The film deals with a group of above-ground human rebels who lure hostile intelligent machines to their laboratory in order to capture them and insert them into a \"matrix\" of their own design. Within this matrix, the humans attempt to teach the captured machines some of the positive traits of humanity, primarily compassion and empathy. The ultimate goal of this project is to help the intelligent machines develop free will in order to overcome their original \"search-and-destroy\" programming, rather than reprogramming it by force. The rebels' hope is that, once converted of its own volition , an \"enlightened\" machine will assist Zion in its struggle against the machine-controlled totalitarianism which currently dominates the Earth. After capturing one of the \"runner\" robots, the rebels insert the machine into their matrix. The experience of the robot leads it to believe it may have a relationship with one of the female rebels, Alexa , either friendship or something deeper. However, the rebel group is attacked by the Machines and unplug themselves to defend their headquarters, but they experience what might be considered a Pyrrhic Victory: all the onscreen rebels are killed but the single robot captured in the film successfully 'reprogrammed', indicated by the machine's mechanical eye changing from red to green. The robot plugs the dying Alexa into their matrix with itself, the only two things left surviving. Much to the machine's dismay, when the rebel realizes she is trapped inside the matrix with the \"friendly\" robot, she turns horrified and her avatar dissolves screaming as she clutches her head, and the robot exits from the rebels' matrix to see a motionless Alexa in front of him in the real world. The film ends with the 'converted' robot standing outside the headquarters of the human rebels, with a light on its back now turned back to the color red.  Final Flight of the Osiris was written by the The Wachowskis and directed by Andy Jones, with CG-animation production and design by Square Pictures, this segment is rated PG-13 by the MPAA for \"Sci-Fi Violence, Sensuality and Language\". The short is a direct prequel leading into the events of The Matrix Reloaded. Thadeus , a muscular man and an athletic woman called Jue  engage in a blindfolded sword fight in a virtual-reality dojo. With each slice of their swords, they remove another piece of each other's clothing. Immediately after cutting the other down to their underwear, they lift their blindfold to peek at the other. As the two are about to kiss, they are interrupted by an alarm and the virtual reality simulation ends. In the next scene, the hovercraft Osiris is headed for Junction 21 when Robbie , the operator, picks up thousands of Sentinels on his HR scans. The ship flees into an uncharted tunnel, where it encounters another group of Sentinels patrolling the area. The crewmembers man the guns onboard and destroy the patrol. The ship then emerges on the surface, four kilometers directly above Zion and close to the army of Sentinels previously detected in the scan. Alerted to the Osiris's presence, the army of Sentinels pursue the ship. Captain Thadeus decides Zion must be warned, and his shipmate Jue volunteers to broadcast herself into the Matrix to deliver the warning while the ship is doggedly pursued. Jue and Thadeus admit to peeking at each other in the VR simulation. Entering the Matrix on a high rooftop, Jue jumps off and acrobatically makes her way down through structure work between two buildings. When she hits the ground in the alley below, a ripple effect is created by her impact. She drops off a package into a mail box. The package sets the prologue for Enter the Matrix. She attempts to contact Thadeus via a cell phone as the Osiris are overcome by Sentinels and crash. The Sentinels tear their way into the ship. At the time of the call, Thadeus is making a last stand to hold off the Sentinels. Shortly after Jue says \"Thadeus\" over her cell phone, the Osiris explodes, destroying many of the pursuing Sentinels. In the Matrix, Jue falls to the ground, dead, her body having been destroyed on the ship.\n","\n","    ### Response:  The Animatrix\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

After moving into his own apartment, Cal goes to a bar night after night, talking loudly about his divorce, until he attracts the attention of a young man named Jacob Palmer . Jacob is a womanizer who beds women each night, although a young woman named Hannah  recently had rejected his advances. Jacob takes pity on Cal, and offers to teach him how to pick up women. Using Jacob's teachings, Cal seduces Kate  at the bar. After this encounter, Cal manages to successfully seduce other women in the bar. He sees Emily again at his son Robbie's  parent-teacher conference. The meeting goes well until they discover Robbie's teacher is Kate, who reveals to Emily that she and Cal slept together. Emily leaves in disgust and begins actively dating David. Meanwhile, Hannah, a recent law school graduate, is expecting her boyfriend, Richard  to propose marriage while they celebrate her passing the bar exam, but he does not, which hurts Hannah's feelings. Hannah returns to the bar where she originally rejected Jacob's advances and kisses Jacob passionately. The two return to Jacob's home to have sex, but end up talking to each other all night and making a connection. Jacob starts a relationship with Hannah, and he becomes distant from Cal. At the same time, Robbie makes numerous grand gestures to try to win the heart of his 17-year-old babysitter, Jessica Riley , who actually has a crush on Cal. On the advice of her classmate Madison , she takes naked photos of herself to send to Cal and tucks them away in an envelope inside her dresser drawer. Later, when Emily calls Cal under the guise of needing help with the house's pilot light, Cal decides to try and win her back. Meanwhile, Jacob returns Cal's calls and asks for advice about starting a real relationship. Jessica's mother, Claire  discovers Jessica's naked photos addressed to Cal in her drawer and shows them to Jessica's father, Bernie . He rushes to the Weaver residence to confront him about the photos. Cal and his kids create a makeshift mini golf set in their backyard to remind Emily of their first date. During the gathering, Jacob and Hannah show up at the house, and Hannah is revealed to be Cal and Emily's daughter. Cal is appalled that Jacob is dating his daughter, and forbids her to see him. At that moment, Bernie shows up and attacks Cal. Jessica arrives and tells her father that Cal knew nothing of the pictures. Then David arrives on the scene to return Emily's sweater from a previous date. Cal, Jacob, David, and Bernie then get into a scuffle which is soon broken up by the police. Cal starts spending his time at the bar again and receives a visit from Jacob, who confesses that he is in love with Hannah. Cal refuses to approve of their relationship. Jacob harbors no ill feelings, but rather respects him and praises him for being a great father. At Robbie's eighth grade graduation, Robbie is the Salutatorian and gives a pessimistic speech about how he no longer believes in true love and soul-mates. Cal stops him and instead begins to recount his courtship with Emily to the audience, saying that, while he doesn't know if things will work out, he will never give up on Emily. With renewed faith, Robbie reaffirms his love for Jessica, to the audience's applause. After the ceremony, Cal gives Jacob and Hannah his blessing.

Deep in the woods, away from civilization, the children are taught the ways of cult-like Christianity, the dangers of lustful temptations and the horrors of the Devil. The charismatic priest, Fr. Phineas McAllister,  who teaches the children the doctrines of their faith has unknowingly brought evil with him by reaching deep into the children's minds, preying on their fears in an attempt to control the next generation. The priest fills these young minds with the belief that everywhere they turn an occasion of sin awaits them.

Eva's death is announced in a movie theater and a public funeral is held in Buenos Aires. Che , an everyman, narrates the story of Eva's rise to power and later illness and death, appearing in many different guises and serving as Eva's conscience and critic. As a young child, Eva attempts to attend her father's funeral in the town of Jun√≠n with her mother and siblings. Despite her father's wife and other family denying her family from entering, Eva pays her last respects to her father. Years later, Eva decides to leave Jun√≠n to seek a better life in Buenos Aires with a tango singer, Agust√≠n Magaldi , with whom she is having an affair. After Magaldi leaves her, she progresses through several relationships with increasingly influential men, becoming a model, actress and radio personality, until her fateful meeting with Colonel Juan Per√≥n  at a fundraiser. Per√≥n's connection with Eva lends him a populist air, since she is from the working class . Eva has a radio show during Per√≥n's rise and uses all her skills to promote Per√≥n, even when the controlling administration has him jailed in an attempt to stunt his political momentum. The groundswell of support Eva generates forces the government to release Per√≥n, and he finds the people enamored of him and Eva. Per√≥n wins election to the presidency and Eva promises the new government will serve the \"descamisados\" . At the start of the Per√≥n government, Eva glamors herself up in fur and jewels and enjoys the privileges of being the first lady. Soon after, Eva embarks on the infamous \"Rainbow Tour\" to Europe. While there she gets mixed receptions from the people; the people of Spain adore her; the people of Italy call her whore and throw things (such as [[Egg  at her, while the Pope gives her a small, meager gift; and the French, while kind to her were also upset that she was forced to leave early as \"she seemed to lose interest, she seemed tired\"; . Upon returning to Argentina, Eva establishes a foundation and distributes aid while the Per√≥nists otherwise plunder the public treasury. Argentine society is very class-based, and the military officer corps and social elites despise Eva's common roots and affinity for the poor. However, over time, as Eva's illness begins to worsen, she is hospitalized and told she is terminally ill. Eventually, as her illness progresses, she declines the position of Vice President she was offered and makes one final broadcast to the people of Argentina. Towards the end of her life, she understands that her life was short because she shone like the \"brightest fire\" and helps Per√≥n prepare to go on without her. A large crowd surrounds the Casa Rosada in a candlelight vigil praying for her recovery when the light of her room goes out, signifying her death. Eva's funeral is shown again. Ch√© is seen at her coffin, laying the blame of her death on Per√≥n. Then he walks up to her glass coffin; kisses it; and walks into the crowd of passing mourners.\n","\n","    ### Response:  Evita\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

As a result, he is unable to hold a responsible job and his wartime girlfriend, Elaine Dickinson , now a stewardess, leaves him. To win her back, Striker overcomes his fear and boards a flight from Los Angeles to Chicago that she is serving on. During the flight, Elaine rebuffs his attempts to win her back over. After dinner is served, many of the passengers fall ill, and fellow passenger Dr. Barry Rumack  quickly realizes that the fish dinner gave some passengers food poisoning. The stewards discover that the cockpit crew, including pilot Clarence Oveur  and co-pilot Roger Murdock , have all come down with food poisoning, leaving no one aboard to fly the plane. Elaine contacts the Chicago control tower for help, and is instructed by tower supervisor Steve McCroskey  to activate the plane's autopilot, a large inflatable doll named \"Otto Pilot\", which will get them to Chicago, but will not be able to land the plane. Rumack convinces Ted to fly the plane, though Ted feels unable to handle the pressure and the unfamiliar aircraft. McCroskey knows that he must get someone else to help talk the plane down and calls Rex Kramer . Kramer was Ted's commanding officer in the war, and despite their dislike, would be the best choice to instruct Striker. As the plane nears Chicago, Ted becomes increasingly stressed and can only land the plane after a pep talk from Dr. Rumack. Furthermore, lightning storms strike the plane, disabling some of its engines. With Kramer's stream of advice, Ted is able to overcome his fears and engine troubles and safely land the plane with only minor injuries to some passengers. Ted's courage rekindles Elaine's love for him, and the two share a kiss while Otto takes off in the evacuated plane after inflating a female companion.\n","\n","    ### Response:  ...And the Truth Shall Set You Free\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

Grant'], Released in the year: 1999, Summary of the movie plot: The Jack Bull is about a normal Horse trader Myrl Redding  who cherishes the law and his rights. He lives a normal life with his son, Cage , his wife Cora  and his good friends. However he clashed one day with Land Baron Henry Ballard  over Wyoming's bid for statehood. If Wyoming remains a territory Henry Ballard can continue to buy more land and eventually evict its residents, however if Wyoming becomes a state then his rights to the land will be restricted. After further conflict with Ballard, Redding attempts to take his horses to a horse market in Casper. However he encounters Ballard, who has built a tollgate that blocks the road to Casper, charging a fee for passage. Redding realizes going around would take too long to get the horses to market on time, with the market closed before he could arrive. Ballard tells Redding that he will allow Redding to cross with a fee of ten dollars. Redding gives him five and leaves two black stallions as collateral for the other five. He also leaves his Indian friend and worker Billy to make sure the horses are not mistreated. Redding arrives at Casper on time and sells his horses, with the exception of the two he left behind and makes his way back to his home. He stops for his horses and finds Billy is missing and his horses are starved, diseased, beaten, and near death. He beats one of Ballard's henchmen and demands that his horses be returned healthy and fed. Ballard says he'll never do it and Redding leaves, saying he has two weeks to comply with his demands. Ballard ignores him and returns to his normal life. Redding returns home and finds Billy beaten and bitten. Billy describes how one of Ballard's henchmen had the two horses chained to a wagon of logs and was beating them when they rested even though they had been working for hours. Billy attempted to stop him but he was attacked by two other henchmen who then set the dogs on him. He said he was forced to flee and would've been killed if he had returned. Redding agrees with Billy and sympathizes with him, telling him it was not his fault for what happened to the horses. He departs that day for the local town and approaches the local lawyer and asks for legal help. The lawyer tells Redding he will probably not win because it is an Indian's word against a wealthy white man's. Redding says to do it anyway and leaves after paying ten dollars in lawyer fees. A week passes and nothing happens, and Redding tells his lawyer to speed up the case. The lawyer intercepts Judge Wilkins, the local judge, on the way to the barber and pleads for a chance to make their case. Wilkins, who has a financial interest in Ballard's business, tells them that he is throwing the case out and advises the lawyer to choose his clients more carefully, stating \"You're shoveling shit out of the mountain.\" The lawyer informs Redding about Judge Wilkins decision and after his wife finds out she tells Redding that she is good friends with the District Attorney's wife, and she departs for Casper to plead their case before the D.A. She and Woody, Redding's trusted friend, depart for Casper and he drops her off in front of the D.A.'s office. When she arrives at the office she is informed she needs an appointment and she reluctantly leaves after leaving her name. However unknown to her two of Ballard's henchmen had beaten Woody and thrown him into a carriage, knocking the driver off. The wild carriage runs her over as she is crossing the street, making her death a very unfortunate coincidence caused by Ballard's men. Woody gives the documented complaint against Ballard directly to the D.A., who emerges to see what has happened. Woody then drives Cora's body back to Myrl's household where they bury her. To make matters worst Redding's lawyer returns with news that the D.A. has sent the case back to Judge Wilkins, who has once again thrown the case out. Redding, distraught with the loss of his wife and realizing that the justice system will do nothing to stop Ballard, takes justice into his own hands and rallies the local farmers against Ballard. Although some have doubts he talks them into joining him with the offer that he will pay each man who joins him fifteen dollars a month. Redding and his new militia of farmers ride towards Ballard's house where they route Ballard's men and Ballard himself flees for his life for Casper. Redding burns down Ballard's stable and leaves for the local town, looking for Ballard. After questioning a local farmer who refuses to tell them Ballard's location, he burns down the farmer's barn and leaves the barn smoldering. They then ride to a local Amish community and threaten to burn down the houses if they hide Ballard or refuse to give them the location. After the Amish people tell him they don't even know Ballard, he asks for a person who knows how to print. They find one and offer him fifteen dollars to mass produce fliers demanding Ballard that he has a week to get the horses fed and healthy. Ballard meanwhile, had reached Casper and pleads for help from the Governor of Wyoming himself. The Governor offers protection and charges the Sheriff to find and arrest Redding. But after only a day of searching, the Sheriff is ambushed during the night and during a brief struggle Redding kills one of Ballard's men, Slater, after he attempts to shoot Billy. He forces the sheriff at gunpoint to say that it was self defense, and after Redding departs the Sheriff returns to Casper and tells news that Slater was shot dead by Redding. Meanwhile Billy, while riding back to Ballard's house is shot by its caretaker Conrad. After a brief firefight Conrad shoots his wife by accident and Billy and Redding leave. Meanwhile the Governor, after conversing with Judge Joe B. Tolliver  and the Attorney General decides to offer Redding amnesty if he turns himself in. Redding accepts but Billy doesn't, saying that land Ballard took belonged to his native tribe. Billy leaves and Redding arrives in Casper to participate in the trial of Henry Ballard. During the trial however the D.A.'s assistant informs them that Judge Wilkins is charging Redding with two counts of murder and armed insurrection. However the amnesty agreement was typed before the charges were sent, putting the Governor in a bind. If he charges Redding, he will break the amnesty agreement, but if he doesn't charge Redding, he will be violating a judge's charges. The governor decides he will charge Redding if he breaks the amnesty agreement. The trial ends after several witnesses testify that the horses were indeed healthy stallions although Ballard testifies otherwise. Judge Tolliver agrees with Redding and orders Ballard to restore the horses to their previous health. Meanwhile, Billy has sued Ballard for the land rights but is losing, so he sends a messenger to Redding in an attempt to gain leverage over Ballard. Redding writes a letter of support but the messenger is ambushed while leaving Redding's hotel. The letter is used as proof to show Redding has violated his amnesty and he is charged with two counts of murder and armed insurrection. He is found guilty one one count of murder and armed insurrection at the same time that Billy and his Indians are ambushed by the Wyoming Army. Redding is sentenced to be hung and Ballard is charged with perjury for lying under oath and sentenced to two years in jail, three months of which will be spent restoring the two stallions' health. Further consequence is that Ballard will lose his life savings. On the day of the hanging Redding meets with his son and tells him to always work hard and never give up. After a heartfelt goodbye Redding is called to inspect the two horses. After confirming that they have been restored, Ballard curses him and claims Redding got nothing from Ballard. Redding replies simply, \"You did what I said you would.\" Ballard is carried away screaming and Redding is marched to the gallows. Judge Tolliver, who seems compassionate toward Redding and his principles, finds Judge Wilkins in a bar. Tolliver angrily berates him for charging an innocent man with murder. He then says that he has sent a letter to the governor asking for a committee, that he'll oversee, to review Wilkins' ability to be a judge, and says he hopes they will find him unable. Judge Wilkins, obviously distraught, attempts to order a drink, to which the bartender replies, \"Ten dollars a shot\", mocking the judge about how Ballard charged Redding ten dollars to cross the land and how Wilkins did nothing about it. The bartender leaves Wilkins miserable and dishonored. Redding walks to the gallows but not before being hugged by his son and another heartfelt goodbye. He is hung and various clips show. One is of his son, Cage and Woody leading the two stallions along with Redding's body away from the city back home. Another shows the Wyoming marching band parading down the street announcing Wyoming has become a state.\n","\n","    ### Response:  The Jack Bull\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

His 19-year-old son Marius works for him at his bar, but wants nothing more than to go to sea and leave his boring existence behind. The only thing holding him back is Fanny, an 18-year-old girl with whom he grew up. Fanny works selling fish with her mother down at the waterfront. Fanny has been in love with Marius her whole life, and flirts with him, but Marius always rejects her. Fanny invites Marius to a Sunday night dance, but he rejects her once more. Unbeknownst to Fanny, Marius is planning to leave the next day, having secretly signed on as a sailor on a lengthy scientific expedition traveling around the world after being encouraged to do so by his friend known as the Admiral. Fanny is offended and leaves. Meanwhile, elderly but wealthy merchant Panisse asks to meet with Fanny's mother Honorine, who believes he wants to propose to her. To her surprise, he wants to marry Fanny, even though he knows she loves someone else. Although disappointed, Honorine does not object, seeing as Panisse is worth 600,000 francs. Fanny tells Marius she has rejected Panisse's proposal because she loves him and is willing to wait until he returns. Marius tells her he will be away for five years and to forget about him. They declare their love for each other and go to Fanny's house, which is empty while her mother is away. The following morning, Honorine discovers Fanny and Marius in bed together. She and C√©sar begin to plan their children's wedding, but Fanny urges Marius to leave, even lying to him, telling him that she would rather marry a rich man like Panisse than she would him. But, in truth, she is fearful he eventually will grow to hate her for depriving him of this great opportunity. Around two months after Marius goes off to sea, Fanny discovers she is pregnant with Marius's child and tells Panisse the news. He is happy to marry her anyway, overjoyed with the possibility of a male heir to carry on his name. They marry and Fanny gives birth to a boy to whom C√©sar is godfather. C√©sar, knowing the baby's true father, collaborates with Panisse to give the baby the name C√©sario Marius Panisse. On C√©sario's first birthday, Panisse leaves on the train to Paris on business, and while he is gone, Marius returns on a short leave. He visits Fanny, and upon learning her child is his, apologizes to Fanny, as he knows now she said those things only to make him go. Marius tells her that he wants her back, but then C√©sar comes in before anything can happen. Panisse then arrives home early and says that he will not try to stop Fanny from leaving with Marius but he will not part with the child, knowing that Fanny won't leave without the boy. Fanny tells Marius she loves him but will not take C√©sario from Panisse, as it was Panisse who had been there for Fanny and C√©sario all along. C√©sar advises his son the father is \"the one who loves,\" and Panisse loves this child and has been a wonderful father to him. Marius then departs with neither Fanny nor his child. Ten years later, C√©sario is looking forward to his birthday party. After being taken to the waterfront with Fanny's mother, C√©sario wanders off and meets the Admiral. The Admiral takes the boy sailing without telling anyone and reunites him with Marius, though C√©sario has no idea who Marius is. Marius, who is now working in a garage, is overjoyed to see his son, but when Panisse is told the boy is missing, he is stricken and taken to his room. Fanny finds C√©sario with his father and is shocked. She announces that Panisse is dying and Marius drives them home to the dying Panisse. When they arrive at the house, Panisse calls for C√©sario to sit with him, leaving Fanny and Marius together. Fanny explains to Marius she never told him about the baby because she fully expected him to take her with him and, when he didn't, she felt betrayed and was angry. Fanny then goes to Panisse and as he lies dying, Panisse dictates a letter asking Marius to marry his wife once he is dead, and be a father to C√©sario; his only request being that the boy keep his last name.\n","\n","    ### Response:  The Unforgiven\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

Del Green ([[Donovan Leitch  is an honors student, highly motivated, who‚Äôs dream is to dance on the Perry Parker show with Vicky . Vicky is a the blond parochial school student, and the shows most popular dancer. One afternoon Del bets his school friends that he will indeed dance with ‚ÄòThe In Crowd‚Äô. The day he chooses happens to be Dugan‚Äôs  first day of banishment. He uses some trickery to get thru the stage door security goons and sneaks into the pre-show dressing room where the ‚Äòin crowd‚Äô muster. He‚Äôs new but not yet a threat to this self-centered group. Vicky shows up late. With the loss of their star male dancer, Dugan, Perry enters the dressing room with a ‚Äòheavy heart‚Äô and a need for one of the other boys to step up and replace Dugan as Vickie‚Äôs partner. Del jumps into the breach, combs his hair and gets a smile from Vicky, and threatening faces from the others. His first appearance is a big hit. TV cameras follow him and his more than adequate dancing with his smiling partner Vicky. The ‚Äòin crowd‚Äô now a bit jealous try to sabotage him during a line dance, but Dell dances his way out of harms way. His friends all watching from home can‚Äôt really believe that Del is so hip, cool and ‚Äòalive‚Äô while dancing. The shows audience of young teens really take a likening to Dell and aren‚Äôt a bit set back at Dugan‚Äôs demise. The show‚Äôs ratings go up and the management likes the new lead dancer, Del is a new member of the ‚ÄòIn Crowd‚Äô. Perry tells the cast to include Del in all their evening and daytime group outings, and Del agrees to even pick up Vicky at her home. Vicky agrees though she has ulterior motives. Del‚Äôs visits Vicky and her mom is in a cloud and sort of floats in time. Her is Tiny, a policeman and later is happy to see a smart college bound young man, a welcome change from Dugan. Del‚Äôs first evening, the group meets at the Germantown Train Station, Vicky sneaks away with Dugan, while the ‚ÄòIn Crowd‚Äô puts Del through a Miller beer shower initiation ceremony, an edgy, ruff experience that Del handles very well. Later Vicky returns, Del takes her home and Tiny forces her to give him a goodnight kiss. A good time was had by all. Del is now a full-fledged ‚ÄòIn Crowd‚Äô member. Next day, Perry Parker and a couple of his muscle men, disrupt Del‚Äôs American English Class where Perry ends up leading the discussion of a ‚ÄòTale of Two Cities‚Äô with the theme of ‚ÄòDying for Love‚Äô. Perry does a layman's rendition of the immensity of dying for love versus his teens just ‚Äòfeeling like they could die for love‚Äô. His thoughts impress the English teacher and show just how ‚Äòin tune‚Äô Perry is with his teens and his audience. Del is dragged out to the car to ogle the hundreds of adoring fan letters sent to him in care of the show. He is offered, ‚Äòpayola, extra money‚Äô for playing a bigger role in that day‚Äôs show. He gets to do the ‚ÄòLover‚Äôs Only‚Äô spotlight dance with Vicky, another big hit for the show and with the home fans and stage audience as well. There are several outings with the ‚ÄòIn Crowd‚Äô, one is on a Philly bus in the market area, lots of dancing, sight gags, teens being teens and the locals joining in with their own dance routines. Good scenes, somewhat in the tradition of the Beatles in a ‚ÄòHard Days Night‚Äô. Vicky and Del are pushed together by show bizz necessity, and they become close, but still there‚Äôs Dugan lurking and scheming in the background. A key daytime outing was to the boardwalk in Wildwood, New Jersey. We see Del and Vicky dressed in wedding costumes and being shown with the Wildwood teens going from business to business on the boardwalk. Perry melts down at a caricature of Dick Clark and has Morris  pay for the destruction of all the drawings. After a photo shoot at Carmines in their Tux and Wedding gown, Del and Vicky meet with the crowd of teens at the end of the pier. Here teens buy record albums so they can be part of a multiplication dance with Del and Vicky. During the middle of the song, Moon River, Del abandons his partner and walks over to invite a young girl to dance with him. She‚Äôs younger than the others, very pretty, dark hair, big eyes and a smile soon to melt everyone‚Äôs heart. She‚Äôs very shy, and doesn‚Äôt feel she can slow dance. She wears a leg brace and has an awkward limp. Del ignores her fear, takes her by both hands, walks to the center of the dance floor and starts dancing. Everyone is stunned at this generous and gracious dance offer by Del. Everyone stalls, stares and smiles at the dancing couple, some swoon. Del and his young partner lean into each other and she puts her head on his chest, smiles and becomes a magical dance partner. One beautifully happy girl becomes the perfect Wildwood teen, her smile seems as large as Del's heart. It‚Äôs a perfect dance scene, the music, the teens all vicariously dancing along with Dell and the young girl. Del returns Vicky home in the rain and at his home finds an open front door. Dugan is there, to challenge Del on his relationship with Vicki. He turns on the stereo, and they have a dance off right there in the living room, each trying to out dance the other, leaps, turning over the sofa, and tumbling off the walls. It ends in a stalemate where both fall back onto the sofa. Dugan opens up with his bigger than life plans to go to California and become a movie star. He struggles with the words in reading few paragraphs from a movie magazine, while Del listens and sees Dugan‚Äôs earnestness and desire to be a success. He also senses that Dugan is a good guy and well-meaning suitor for Vicky. Dugan really dreams of Vicky becoming another Natalie Wood, a dream both Vicky and he share. At the end of the visit, the two young men know what‚Äôs up, and Gail  his next door neighbor drops in for a visit and is roughly kissed by Dugan. He leaves and Gail tells Del that he‚Äôs hanging out with the ‚Äòwrong crowd‚Äô and is not going to make it into a good ivy league college, and by the way he is alienating his school friends. Del is caught in between the two worlds, his old friends and his more famous, edgy and exciting ‚ÄòIn Crowd‚Äô friends. Vicky invites Del over to work on her homework and he thinks it‚Äôs just another ruse to get out of the house and go on another date with Dugan. Turns out the she really wanted to work a bit on her school work and be with him not Dugan. More friction emerges in another date where Del takes Vicky to see Gail perform in her senior class play. At dinner after the play Vicky is humiliated by Gail and her dinner group when Vicky tells them that she is reading a piece of ‚Äòfriction‚Äô. Vicky doesn‚Äôt understand her error, but stands, excuses herself and pauses to tell Gail that she really enjoyed Gail‚Äôs performance in the play. A great cudo from her heart that catches the whole table by surprise. Del angrily leaves to find her. The British invasion has hurt the Perry Parker show ratings, so after he interviews a crude bunch of Brits, Perry goes ballistic. This turns out to be the last show, so Perry gives the ‚ÄòIn Crowd‚Äô instructions to cut loose, they dances wildly and are blacked out. Del takes out Vicky one more time with a borrowed car he gets through Gail. His plan was for Vicky to meet Dugan and run off to Hollywood, somehow Tiny gets wind of the plan and tries to stop the couple, Del crashes the borrowed Caddy into his police car to free Dugan and Vicky who make their escape on Dugan‚Äôs motorcycle. The last scene shows a grounded Del in his house. Gail comes by to play a new kind of music for him, Bob Dylan, while she wears a leather headband, mini-skirt and high top suede boots.He is stunned by her new appearance and can't take his eyes off of her. She feels connected to Del via the Dylan music/poetry, and Del finds solace in his re-ordered life. The two share a charged look, perhaps hinting of things to come.\n","\n","    ### Response: ‚ÄòForever Young‚Äô\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

She is particularly interested in Andy, whose father, also a detective, was murdered in the line of duty. Things are complicated further with Agent Brown's investigation into Andy and his crew. Brown tells Andy that he has an informant who is leaking out the details, and Andy, disbelieving at first, begins to resign himself to the fact that one of his men is betraying him. After Captain Friendly is assassinated by a local gangster named Chamorro, Andy, Stan, Pepe, and Barney decide to take the law into their own hands and go after Chamorro. While interrogating Chamorro, they find out that Brown has been supplying the drug dealer with information about the police raids, to help his own investigation. In a violent shootout, Barney accidentally shoots and kills Pepe. Andy and Stan escape, only to return to the warehouse where they met. There Andy realizes that Stan is the informant. After the two start arguing, Brown shows up and there is another shootout, ending in Brown's death. Andy comforts a sobbing Stan, then Andy kills his partner, as he possibly did with his previous one. The film ends on a low note, leaving no premise about Andy's future.\n","\n","    ### Response: 50 Cent: The Big Bang\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

He was jailed by the Vichy government on charges of desertion, but escaped from jail to join Charles de Gaulle's forces operating out of England, and later served as Prime Minister of liberated France. Part Two, The Choice, revolves around Christian de la Mazi√®re, who is something of a counterpoint to Mend√®s-France. Whereas Mend√®s-France was a French Jewish political figure who joined the Resistance, de la Mazi√®re, an aristocrat who embraced Fascism, was one of 7,000 French youth to fight on the Eastern Front wearing German uniforms. The film shows the French people's response to occupation as heroic, pitiable, and monstrous, sometimes all at once. The postwar humiliation of the women who served  Vichy men perhaps gives the strongest mix of all three.

Thrown out of the house by his mother and ignored by his more academically gifted and successful younger brother, Louis, he had a hard time running away from debt collectors until one day he met a young girl named Gigi after a run-in with some of the debt collectors' men. Gigi started out as a thief, but because she fell for him and gave him immense luck, Andy gained great success with his extreme good luck in mahjong games and became very rich. However he refused to marry Gigi because she, though a nice woman when with him, was in reality quite a sore loser who threw temper tantrums while on the verge of losing mahjong games. She could not understand that he couldn't stand the way she behaved. As Andy said, her behaviour could be revealed by just playing a game of mahjong where when she lost, she would throw the tables. He promised her that he would marry her if she could play a game of mahjong without such a bad temper. She couldn't and so he couldn't marry her though he loved her. In the meantime, Andy found his mother who was now suffering from Alzheimer's disease and his brother who faced bankruptcy and moved in with Andy, who coincidentally lived in a bungalow. Not wanting to lose out in finding a job, Louis who had excellent luck in Mahjong but zero skill, was conned out of all his money and even his clothes by a skilled, yet devious mahjong player, Sean, portrayed by Lau Ching-wan. But being a kind hearted simpleton, a woman on the con team,  fell for him and decided to mend her ways. In the meantime, Gigi who was very disappointed with Andy's refusal to marry her, went with the bad crowd, in the form of mahjong con men led by Lau Ching-wan. Andy who was cursed by Gigi lost his winning streak and instead found a living as a taxi driver and moved into public housing. Being ever optimistic, he did not complain. However, not wanting Gigi to fall into the con men's trap, he played a game of mahjong with Sean and lost terribly. But Gigi was touched by his actions and went back to him, promising she will return a better woman. But before she left, she gave Andy a blessing and from there on, Andy's winning streak came back. Louis who had created a mahjong computer game with his new girlfriend , received word that there would be a Mahjong tournament sponsored by his game.

The lander carries two astronauts, one of them a black male model, James Washington, specifically chosen to aid the President of the United States in her re-election . Upon landing on the Far side of the Moon they encounter the Nazis who have hidden there since 1945. Washington is taken captive and the other astronaut killed. Nazi scientist Doktor Richter investigates Washington and finds his smartphone. Although initially skeptical, he recognizes that its computing power outstrips all their technology combined. Moreover it serves perfectly as a control unit for space battleship G√∂tterd√§mmerung. When he strives to demonstrate the completion of his Wunderwaffe to the current F√ºhrer, Wolfgang Kortzfleisch, the phone runs out of power. Nazi commander Klaus Adler, who is  chosen to mate with Earth specialist Renate Richter, Doktor Richter's daughter, offers to go to Earth to collect more phones. Adler takes a spacecraft to Earth, taking James with him, who has been bleached by Richter. Upon landing they find that Renate has stowed away and travelled with them. Meanwhile on Earth, the President of the United States has to tackle political issues; she desperately needs a miracle to ensure her re-election. Her aide, Vivian Wagner , introduces the Nazi couple to her. Adler and Richter go on to revamp the President's campaign Nazi-style, with apparent success, while the clueless Richter is unaware of Adler's ambition to become the next F√ºhrer and rule the world. After three months, Kortzfleisch seems to have figured out Adler's plan. He sends his armada  to Earth orbit. He himself lands on Earth and confronts Adler, but is consequently killed by him and Vivian. Adler declares himself the new F√ºhrer before he returns to orbit with Kortzfleisch's flying saucer. At the same time, Renate Richter comes across the now homeless Washington who makes her realise that terrestrial Nazis are not to her liking. The United Nations assemble to discuss the extra-terrestrial Nazi threat. The President is excited to finally have a war which will likely get her re-elected, and appoints Vivian Wagner as commander of the spacecraft USS George W. Bush, which orbits the Earth carrying nuclear weapons. As it turns out, most of the other nations have also developed armed spacecraft, and join in to defeat the invading Nazi armada. Back on Earth, Richter convinces Washington to come with her back to the Moon to stop Adler. They take Adler's flying saucer back to the Moon and to the G√∂tterd√§mmerung, where Washington attempts to disable the engines while Renate goes looking for Adler. Meanwhile, the international spacecraft armada has destroyed the Swastika moonbase and is heading for the G√∂tterd√§mmerung as well. In the final battle, Washington manages to disconnect the tablet device now controlling the G√∂tterd√§mmerung while Richter takes out Adler. The spaceship crashes into the Moon, but not before Adler has taken out a considerable chunk of the Moon attempting to get a clear shot at the Earth. The U.S. President calls Wagner from the UN session, congratulating her on her victory. Wagner discloses she detected large tanks of Helium-3 on the Moon. This material would keep the United States independent of foreign power sources for a millennium. Consequently the U.S. president immediately lays claim to it. This enrages a white-haired UN member  who throws his shoe at her. All UN members join the following \"meeting hall battle\". This leads to an international turmoil and eventually even the international spacecraft of the hitherto allied nations start attacking each other. Richter meets up with Washington  in the damaged Swastika moonbase, where they embrace in front of Richter's flabbergasted former students and some adults who have fled there from other parts of the base. Richter states that \"[they] have a lotta work cut out for [them]\". The final moments of the film show the Earth, where missiles are causing nuclear explosions across the globe. At the very end of the credits, the planet Mars is revealed with a man-made satellite of undetermined origin in orbit.\n","\n","    ### Response:  Iron Sky\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

At breakfast, the older brothers, Jorge  and Sergio  argue with their father Humberto . The boys are studying at the university and their father works at the Departamento del Distrito Federal . The argument begins when the father complains that the boys have long hair. The argument escalates and then they begin to argue that what the boys are doing is wrong, and that \"no one should question the government\". The boys say that the autonomy of the university was violated and that the government does things against the constitution. Their grandfather Roque  , says that \"If they were on a real revolution, they would be executed\". The younger siblings Carlos  and Graciela , who study primary and secondary school, barely understand what the argument is all about, because of their young age. The boys then talk about the injustice of the government. Their prime example is the occupation of the U.N.A.M. and that some students hid in the bathroom, and their corpses were found the day before . The mother, Alicia  tries to calm down the situation and tells the boys to \"come early and cut their hair\". The boys jokingly state that Miguel Hidalgo had long hair , then leave. The day continues normally and then, while cooking, Alicia and Graciela argue about what the boys are doing. Graciela says that her mother is \"out of style\", then says that she would like to continue studying, to which her mother replies that she will end up being a homemaker anyway. Carlos is getting ready for school while listening to the Beatles, his grandfather complains that \"they're too loud\" and turns the radio off. Humberto tries to call his wife and tells her that \"something big is about to happen and that he is worried\", but before he can continue the phone dies. Alicia asks Graciela to go to the neighbor's apartment and try to call her father. Graciela does so and finds out that the neighbor's phone is dead. She returns and says that the phones do not work, \"neither ours, nor the neighbor's, nor the one in the corner\". Sometime later, the light goes out as well. Don Roque goes to the bottom floor and changes the fuse. He bumps into the neighbor on the way and they both change fuses. They then try to turn on the light and discover that the light got cut out. Don Roque then returns to the apartment and tells Alicia that the light does not work. They both worry and carry on with their day. Carlos returns from school. He tells his mother that he asked the teacher whether what his brothers said was true, and says the teacher confirmed it. He then goes outside to the building's hall to play with his toy soldiers with his grandfather. As they are playing, suspicious men with sniper rifles and white handkerchiefs in their left hands try to take a look through an opening on the hall. They find it \"inappropriate\" and go to upstairs floors. The two return to the apartment and Don Roque talks with his daughter about the military presence and the snipers at the roof of each building. Why? She asks. The answer is very simple: because they are prepared for something big. Alicia starts sewing something, Carlos does his homework and Don Roque tries to repair a watch. At the square outside, a crowd begins to gather. A student meeting is taking place. Carlos and Graciela watch the crowd and estimate more than 10,000 present. Graciela then goes to a friend's house to do her homework. After half an hour, the meeting is interrupted as red and green flares soar across the sky. Carlos sees this, excited, and tells his mom. Alicia peeks through the window and sees that the students are being slaughtered. Don Roque tells them to get away from the window and to hide in his room. As they do so, two bullets pierce the window. After some time, Don Roque tries to pick up Graciela, but before he does, he hears a sound. \"Tanks!\" he exclaims. Then it starts to rain. After some time, there are sounds from outside. The door opens and Serigio and Jorge  arrive, along with some mates. One of them, Luis , is wounded. Alicia tries to heal him, but he is bleeding badly. The shooting goes on and stops. During that time, the soaked students begin to trade stories. One of them says that he was on the building's third floor balcony, where the speech was being given, and said that armed people dressed as civilians yelled \"Olimpia Batallion! Nobody move!\". Another one says that he was leaving when the shooting started. The brothers say that the speaker yelled to the crowd \"not to fall on provocations\". Luis says that he was from the \"Poli\"  and was running with the crowd when he felt pain in his elbow, then found out he was shot, then afterwards lost his little sister. Another one claims that two dead children no older than 10 ended up on top of each other. A female student claims she saw the Plaza full of shoes. The students peek through the pierced window and see \"nothing but shadows\" . Don Roque arrives with Graciela and some soldiers, who are in the search for students. Don Roque says that he was a captain in the Revolution and searches for his papers. As he does so, the snipers come from upstairs holding three blood-soaked students. They punch them and then are told to \"take them with the others\". Don Roque comes back and gives his papers to the soldier, who tells them not to open to anyone. The old man goes back inside and says that the students were arrested and sent to military trucks, as well as that there were garbage trucks and firemen outside. Graciela says that they had to take the stairs and saw the elevator's doors pierced by bullets. Her mother says that it was practically impossible since they were \"made of thick steel\". The female student, who held the propaganda money, talks with Alicia. Alicia keeps the money on a jar until \"things get calm\", then says that the girl's parents would be worried, but the girl does not think so. Alicia says that it was impossible, \"by this time, the whole country is already aware of what happened here\", but the girl answers that \"not everything that the news says is true, and not everything that happens makes it into the news as well\". She goes into the bathroom to dry her soaked hair, when Graciela confronts her telling her \"to be a woman and not to be in Men Things\", to which the student replies \"this is a matter of both men and women\". Humberto calls and tells the family not to open to anyone. In a short time, some boys call their houses to assure their families they're OK. A second shooting ensues and the lights are shut down. The group sleeps and a woman starts crying outside looking for his son \"To√±o\". The students awake and ask if anyone is named To√±o. None of them is named like so. Finally, the lights come back on and Humberto arrives. He says that \"it was really hard to get past the security\". He also says that ambulances were on the surrounding area of the square, but none of them seemed to take the wounded to hospitals and that students were stripped and pushed to the bottom floor's elevator walls. One of the students asks whether they were being beaten up. Humberto confirms this harshly. They then turn the T.V. on and the local news says that the shooting took place because \"student snipers on the nearby buildings fired at the army, which was sent to support the police\". One of the students says the obvious: the government controls the local news as well, confirming the female student's claims. The group then goes to sleep, while the students plan their escape: the next day they'll \"leave the house one by one\". At the eerie sights of morning, the snipers bang on the door. After a harsh awakening, the students hide in the bathroom and one of them tells Humberto not to open. Carlos hides under his bed and the boys pretend to be asleep. Humberto asks who they are, but the snipers insist on opening. Humberto opens and the snipers act fiercely, pointing their guns at everyone. Humberto tells them of his position at the government, but they don't seem to care. They force everyone out of their beds and discover the boys' room full of leftist propaganda: \"The Communist Manifesto\" and a Che Guevara poster on their wall. They are forced to get out of their room and are asked if they were in on the meeting. Jorge answers, but Sergio does not and is pistol-whipped. They discover the bathroom is locked and Don Roque says Carlos is inside because he's scared. They then inspect the apartment because of the boys' leftist propaganda and find the blood-stained sheet on which Luis laid. Then they threaten to kill Humberto at gunpoint if the bathroom door does not open. Sergio, his mouth still full of blood, begs his mates to open the door. One of the snipers, meanwhile, shoots the doorknob of the bathroom and force everyone to leave. Some students stay put, while a student and the girl try to escape. Both are shot by the snipers. Other students also shout and are killed. A fight ensues. Jorge, Don Roque and Humberto try to over-power the snipers as Sergio and Graciela escape. The snipers win and shoot everyone. They then run to the hall to search for Sergio and Graciela. Two gunshots are heard. Carlos is the sole survivor as he gets out of his bed and sees the corpses in the hall. He starts to cry and goes barefoot down the blood-stained stairs. He sees his brother's corpse on the stairs with two bullet holes on his chest, then keeps walking down and finds his sister dead in at the foot of some stairs. He manages to get to the bullet-hit bottom floor and sees two soldiers, while in the background a government janitor  sweeps the floor, which contains student propaganda, finally the film ends.\n","\n","    ### Response: 2 October\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

Freddie makes the mistake of telling the mysterious figure that he left it in his room. He is left in the hole, but is eventually rescued by the two police officers. Back at the hotel, everyone has gathered together and Stone returns with some muddy shoes that belong to Melton , the hotel manager, which proves that he was the one in the caverns with Freddie. His motive for the murder was that he, Relia and Millford, Strickland's secretary, were blackmailing the owner Mr. Crandell. When Strickland found out, he came to investigate, so Melton killed him. Millford then sent down the former clients to use as decoys for the police, but Melton then killed Relia and Millford to cover it all up.

Following the death of one of his workers in an accident, Plainview adopts the man's orphaned son. The boy, whom he names H. W. , becomes his nominal business \"partner\". Nine years later, Plainview is approached by Paul Sunday , who tells him about the oil deposit under his family's property in Little Boston, California. Plainview attempts to buy the farm at a bargain price but Paul's twin brother Eli , wise to Plainview's plan, holds out for $5,000, wanting the money to fund the local church, of which he is the pastor. Plainview has Eli's father agree to the bargain price instead, and goes on to acquire the available land in the area, except for one holdout, William Bandy . Oil production begins. Later, an on-site accident kills a worker, and later still, a large explosion robs H. W. of his hearing. One day, a visitor  arrives on Plainview's doorstep claiming to be his half-brother, Henry, seeking work. Plainview takes the stranger in, and though H. W. discovers flaws in his story, he keeps the news to himself; the boy then attempts to kill Henry by setting his bed linen alight. Angered at his son's behavior, Plainview sends the boy away to a school in San Francisco. A representative from Standard Oil offers to buy out Plainview's local interests, but Plainview elects to strike a deal with Union Oil and construct a pipeline to the California coast, though the Bandy ranch remains an impediment. After spending more time with Henry, Plainview also becomes suspicious; Henry confesses that he was actually a friend of the real Henry, who had died from tuberculosis. Plainview kills the imposter and buries his body. The next morning, Plainview is awakened by Mr. Bandy, who appears to be aware of the previous night's events. Bandy agrees to Plainview's deal but only on the provision that the latter mend his ways and join the Church of the Third Revelation, where Eli humiliates him as part of his initiation. Plainview soon reunites with H. W., and Eli eventually leaves town to perform missionary work. In 1927, a much older H. W.  marries his childhood sweetheart, Mary Sunday . By this time his father, now an alcoholic but extremely wealthy, is living in a mansion with only a servant for company. H. W. asks his father  to dissolve their partnership so he can establish his own business. Plainview mocks his son's deafness and tells him of his true origins, leaving H. W. with no regrets when he finally leaves. Eli, now a radio host and the head of a larger church, visits Plainview. Eli, in dire financial straits, explains that Mr. Bandy has died, and offers to broker a deal on his land. Plainview agrees to the deal if Eli confesses, \"I am a false prophet; God is a superstition\", subjecting Eli to the same humiliation Eli had put him through years earlier. Eli does so after much berating by Plainview. To Eli's horror, Plainview reveals that he had already drained the oil from the property through surrounding wells by saying, \"I drink your milkshake.\" Plainview suddenly goes into a rage, chases Eli about the room, and then beats him to death with a bowling pin. When Plainview's butler comes down to check on him, Plainview simply says \"I'm finished.\"\n","\n","    ### Response:  There Will Be Blood\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

Carlito vows to be through with his criminal activities but is persuaded to accompany his young cousin Guajiro  to a drug deal held at a bar. Guajiro is betrayed and killed by his suppliers and Carlito is forced to shoot his way out. Afterwards, Carlito takes Guajiro's $30,000 from the botched deal and uses it to buy into a nightclub owned by a gambling addict named Saso  with the intent on saving $75,000 to retire to the Caribbean. As nightclub co-owner, Carlito declines several offers for a business partnership with an ambitious, albeit obnoxious, young gangster from the Bronx named Benny Blanco . Carlito also rekindles his romance with his former girlfriend Gail , a ballet dancer who moonlights as a stripper. Kleinfeld develops a love interest with Benny's girlfriend, Steffie, a waitress at Carlito's nightclub. Benny's frustration with Carlito's constant rejections boils over and he confronts Carlito one night at his table. Carlito publicly humiliates Benny, who reacts by manhandling Steffie. Fueled by his now extensive use of alcohol and cocaine, Kleinfeld brazenly pulls out a gun and threatens to kill Benny, but Carlito intervenes. Despite being personally threatened by Benny himself, Carlito lets Benny go unharmed; a decision which alienates Carlito's gangster friend and personal bodyguard Pachanga . Kleinfeld, who stole one million dollars in payoff money from his Italian mob-boss client, Anthony \"Tony T\" Taglialucci, is coerced into providing his yacht to help Tony T break out of the Rikers Island prison barge. Kleinfeld begs for Carlito's assistance in the prison break, and Carlito reluctantly agrees. Under cover of night, Carlito, Kleinfeld, and Tony T's son, Frankie, sail to a floating buoy outside of the prison barge where Tony T is waiting. As they pull Tony T aboard, Kleinfeld unexpectedly bludgeons him to death then slits Frankie's throat and dumps both of their bodies in the East River. Carlito immediately severs his ties with Kleinfeld and decides to leave town with Gail. The next day, Kleinfeld barely survives a retaliatory assassination attempt when he's stabbed in the chest at his office by two mobsters. Carlito is apprehended by police and taken to District Attorney Norwalk's  office where he is played a tape of Kleinfeld making a deal and offering to testify to false criminal allegations against Carlito. Norwalk advises that he is aware of Carlito as an accomplice to the Taglialucci murders in an attempt to leverage him into betraying Kleinfeld to save himself, but Carlito refuses. Carlito visits Kleinfeld under police protection in the hospital, where Kleinfeld confesses to selling him out; Carlito warns Kleinfeld that he's crossed the line from being a lawyer to acting like a gangster, and other gangsters will treat him accordingly. Carlito then buys train tickets to Miami for himself and Gail, now pregnant. When he stops by his club to get the stashed money, Carlito is met by a group of Italian mobsters led by Vinnie. The Italians plan on killing Carlito, but he manages to slip out through a secret exit. The Italians pursue him throughout the city's subway system and into Grand Central Terminal where they engage in a gunfight. Carlito kills all of his pursuers except Vinnie, who is shot and killed by police attracted by the gunfire. As Carlito runs to catch the train where Gail and Pachanga are waiting for him, he is ambushed by a disguised Benny, who shoots Carlito several times in the abdomen with a silenced gun. Pachanga admits to the dying Carlito that he is now working for Benny, only to be shot as well. Carlito hands a tearful Gail the money and tells her to escape with their unborn child and start a new life elsewhere. As he is wheeled away on a gurney, Carlito stares at a billboard with a Caribbean beach and a picture of a woman. The billboard then comes to life in his mind, and the woman, who is clearly Gail, starts dancing as Carlito slowly passes away.\n","\n","    ### Response: √Ç¬¢Carlito's Way √Ç¬¢\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

The only dwelling on the island, Fairweather Cottage, is seasonally operated by the owner Doug from the mainland and only reachable by ferry. After previously suffering a miscarriage, Kate's relationship with Martin has become tense, and in an effort to rekindle their marriage they decide on a return visit to the island. A few nights into their stay, the generator in the cottage explodes, injuring Martin's arm and leaving them without electricity. They use the CB radio, their only source of communication to the mainland, to call Doug who agrees to ferry out to help them. Kate spends the next day waiting at the jetty for Doug to arrive, but to no avail. Later a mysterious man in green combat fatigues washes up on the island, bloodied and half-conscious. When he comes round, he identifies himself as a soldier, Private Jack Coleman . He tells Martin and Kate that there has been an outbreak of an airborne disease, Argromoto Flu, codenamed R1N16, which started in South America and has spread over the entire world in the timespan of a few weeks. The virus is incurable and highly contagious, attacking the respiratory system and causing the victims to choke on blood with a 100% fatality rate. Jack says that the military has lost control, and is now advising civilians to seal themselves up in their homes and not allow anybody access. With only static now coming from the CB radio, Martin decides to play it safe and help Jack, who aggressively takes command, board up the door and the windows. Over the next few days, Jack becomes increasingly strange and erratic, and his intimidating behaviour begins to disturb the couple even further. They even suspect that the virus may not be real and Jack may be insane. When Kate asks him if he is married, he tells her his wife died of R1N16 and he becomes aggressive and threatening. Martin and Kate decide to leave the cottage and take their chances outside, but Jack refuses to let them, forcing them into the bedroom at gunpoint and locking them in. Martin sneaks outside through a skylight, finding the bodies of Doug and his wife at the pier, killed by gunshot wounds. Using Doug's hunting shotgun, Martin returns to the cottage and gets the upper hand on Jack. However, just as Kate begins to tie Jack's hands behind his back, Martin suddenly begins coughing up blood; it appears the Argromoto Flu is very real and he is infected. Kate is forced to shoot her husband dead with the shotgun, to spare him a slow and agonising death. Jack reveals to Kate that he was experimented upon at a secure military compound, from where he was released without realizing he was a carrier of R1N16. Jack infected his wife, killing her, and he fled to Blackholme Island to quarantine himself. Jack reveals the CB radio worked all along, and he just changed the settings so Kate and Martin would not be able to reach anyone. Jack fixes the CB radio and the military broadcast on it claims the soldiers have a vaccine to the virus. He tells her that the military are lying, there is no vaccine, and that the military will not allow them to leave the island alive. Kate does not believe him, and angered by the possibility that Martin could have been saved she shoots Jack dead. As she attempts to leave the island in the boat with Martin's body, a military helicopter flies over and she is killed by a sniper who shoots her in the head.\n","\n","    ### Response: 44 Inch Chest\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

Seeing that she is not dead, he kills her with a broken piece of mirror, saying he couldn't let the darkness take her. The film then switches to present day, and Molly's story. Molly Hartley , a 17-year-old girl, is stabbed with scissors in the chest one day after school in the bathroom by her deranged mother Jane . Although she survives and her wound is healed with only a scar left, she is still haunted in her dreams and hears things because of the frightening experience. Molly lives with her father Robert  and her mother is locked up in a mental ward outside the town she recently moved to. Her father enrolls Molly in a new school to help with the trauma and start a new life. However, as her 18th birthday approaches, Molly must deal with both the stress of being a new student and with the continuing nightmares she has of her mother's attack. Joseph , a student at her new school, attempts to help her. However, Molly begins to display symptoms of the same psychosis that took control of her mother's life. One night, her mother escapes and tries to kidnap her, but Molly escapes. The next morning she is cornered by Jane and discovers that she, and others who share her mother's concerns, want to kill her in order to save her from a preordained life as a servant to Satan. It's revealed that Molly had died as the result of a miscarriage and her parents made a pact with the devil disguised as a woman to save her life. The terms of the agreement were such that the Hartleys would only have Molly until her 18th birthday, then she would belong to the devil. After her mother is accidentally killed by falling down to the floor and upon knocking her father out, Molly turns to Joseph for help discovering that he is one of them and has set her up by taking her to his house. Dr. Emerson  arrives at Joseph's house and tells Molly that she is also to be a servant of the devil. She says Molly can either kill her father to break the pact, or submit to the devil. She attempts to let her father live and not join the devil by stabbing herself in the chest with a kitchen knife in an effort to commit suicide. This attempt is in vain because the clock has already struck midnight. The movie switches to a mental institution, where a doctor is talking to a woman dressed in black, later revealed to be a cold-hearted Molly. It is revealed that Molly's father has now been admitted to the institution; Molly casually smiles and says she will not speak to him, instead choosing to move on. Molly becomes valedictorian of her high school, and dates Joseph. She is seen leaving her high school graduation with Joseph in a limousine, after being told by Dr. Emerson  that they'll \"see her soon.\"\n","\n","    ### Response: 18 Years\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

We meet haggard Vice Principal Rubell  and clueless Principal Horn, as well as stuffy lawyer and former JFK alumna Lisa Hammond , who is in charge of taking depositions for the Calvin case, in which a recent graduate is suing the school for giving him a diploma despite his illiteracy. Alex Jurel  is a veteran Social Studies teacher who takes his job lightly despite being one of the most popular teachers in school because of his ability to identify and connect with the students. Jurel has been worn down by years of being in-between the rowdy students and the demands of the administration . He is assigned to temporarily take over the duties of the school psychologist  and meets a young man named Eddie Pilikian  to whom he becomes a mentor. The major plotline centers on the Calvin lawsuit, with Superintendent Donna Burke  and school lawyer Al Lewis  attempting to avoid bad publicity associated with the case. To this end, they try to figure out which teachers will \"rock the boat,\" or are critical of the school board policies. Intertwined with the major storyline are Jurel's efforts to reform Pilikian into a student who believes in himself and Jurel's growing moral conundrum that ultimately culminates in a showdown with Dr. Burke, who threatens to fire Jurel if he does not resign. A number of minor plotlines deviate from the primary goings-on. These include Herbert Gower/Stuart Van Ark , an outpatient from a mental institution who is accidentally put in charge of a U.S. History class and makes it fun and engaging; gym teacher Mr. Troy‚Äôs sexual relationship with a student that ends with Jurel taking the girl to an abortion clinic ; and the death of Eddie Pilikian‚Äôs friend Danny , a schizophrenic and kleptomaniac student who is shot and killed by the police after he draws a gun from his locker during a drug search. A romance also begins between Jurel and the attorney Lisa Hammond who at one point strips herself naked in the middle of a hallway. This incident causes Pilikian to pull the fire alarm. While the school is outside, Jurel stands up to Dr. Burke and Vice Principal Rubell saying that he won't resign, and he'll sue them if he gets fired. Jurel then makes a speech about how the whole reason for building the school was for the kids, and how the teachers are supposed to be there for them, which causes the other students to give him an ovation while going back into the building. By the end of the film, Lisa manages to convince Jurel that despite their many flaws, the students of JFKHS are worth risking reputation and career.\n","\n","    ### Response: 1984\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

Stravinsky has chosen to flee to France following the Russian Revolution. An immediate sympathy and attraction occurs between the ‚Äòcouturiere‚Äô and the composer. Chanel invites Stravinsky to live in her villa outside Paris, along with his ailing wife and their children. The summer months that follow see Chanel and Stravinsky begin an affair, one which Stravinsky's wife can not avoid becoming aware of. Tensions between Stravinsky and his wife, and between Stravinsky's wife and Chanel, are unavoidable. The film implies that the affair, and the later termination of the affair by Chanel, has a major influence on the lives of both Chanel and Stravinsky. It is during this time that Chanel creates Chanel No. 5 with her perfumer, Ernest Beaux, and that Stravinsky begins to compose in a new, more liberated style. It is especially implied that the termination of the affair inspired some of the most moving passages in Stravinsky's new composition.\n","\n","    ### Response:  Coco Chanel\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

Four children: Andreu Ramallo, Manuel Tur, Pau Inglada and a girl Francisca are witness to the execution of leftists at the hands of pro-Franco villagers. In a desperate act of revenge, Pau, whose father has been killed the previous day by the lead executioner, plans to avenge his father's murder torturing Juli√† Ballester, the son of his father's killer. His idea is to force the boy to drink castor oil. However, things go wrong when the boy‚ÄîJuli√† Ballester‚Äîtaunts them and Pau becomes enraged. He brutally kills Juli√† by bashing his head against a rock and then stabbing him in the throat. Unable to deal with what he has just done, Pau commits suicide jumping inside a hole on a cave. The remaining children: Andreu, Manuel, and Francisa are witnesses to these tragic events. Over a decade later, Ramallo, now a cocky young man, is sent to a tuberculosis sanatorium on Mallorca to recuperate from the initial stages of the disease. Ramallo, like all the tubercular and lung diseased patients, has to live in a large room, dormitory style. However, as a patient's health dwindles and they are expected to die, they are sent to a private room numbered 13 for their final days. Ramallo with his boastfulness and stories of sexual prowess attracts the admiration of the other patients particularly from Galindo, the youngest of the group. Ramallo is shocked to find that Manuel Tur, his childhood friend, is also a patient. A pale and drawn man, Manuel has found solace to his health predicament in religion. Even more shocking is the sight of the beautiful Francisca, now a selfless nun, nursing the sick at the hospital. Alcantara, the brutal caretaker and Carmen, his unhappy wife, run the place. Shortly after his arrival, Ramallo receives the unwanted visit of Don Eugeni Morel his former boss in smuggling contraband. The well to do middle age Morel, has also sexually abused him for long time. Morel's visit makes Ramallo furious and from then on, he tries to disassociate himself from the crime lord. As a reminder than he can count only on himself, Ramallo gets his own name tattooed on his chest by Alcantara, the hospital's maintenance guy. In the clinic, Manuel has a pet cat that he dotes on. In a fit of anger Ramallo kicks the cat almost to death. Manuel gives the dying animal back to Ramallo to put it out of its misery. They bury the animal together and reconcile remembering their childhood friendship. Ramallo wants to get rid of Morel for good, but his first attempt to steal some money from the church of the sanatorium fails when he is discovered by Francisca. As a child, she had a crush on him and now she is glad to see him again, but assures him that she is perfectly happy in her life as a nun. Ramallo starts scheming to hijack smuggling good from Morel. He recruits Manuel in helping him to steal the keys of Alcantara's car in order to go to the nearby port. In the middle of this dealing, Galindo's death affects Ramallo deeply. Carmen has a soft spot for Manuel and seduces him. At first Manuel tries to resist the temptation because she is a married woman, but she assures him that she is unhappy in her marriage and only feels disgust for her husband. They have sex, but when Manuel finds out that she came to visit him on Ramallo's suggestion, he tells her to leave him alone. Manuel angrily confronts Ramallo accusing him of being jealous of his purity. Ramallo leaves him silent telling him that his anger comes because he is secretly in love with him. In fact attracted to his friend, Manuel steals Ramallo's clothes but, in his morbid religious fervor, fights his desires that he believes are diabolical.

Francisca accidentally discovers Ramallo's schemes but does not turn him in, instead she travels with Manuel to recover from the cave in which Pau committed suicide, the items Ramallo stole from Morell. Ramallo escapes the sanatorium and returns to Morel's home. When Morell tells him that Manuel betrayed him, giving away the location of his purloined goods, Ramallo murders Morell with an axe.

The two men, Goro and Yoshi, had brawled earlier that day, and no sooner had they entered the mine then the shaft had quickly flooded. Shigeru Kawamura , head of security at the mine, heads below to investigate. There, he and the local police make a gruesome discovery: Yoshi's lacerated corpse. Above ground, a doctor examines Yoshi, and discovers the cause of death to be a series of deep gashes caused by an abnormally sharp object. As some of the miners comfort Yoshi's wailing wife, the others discuss the possibility of Goro's involvement in the death. The two had never been friends, and had physically fought that morning. Also, Goro was still missing, and could be on the run or still be hiding in the mine. Shigeru warns them not to speak of this until the police investigation begins. Outside, Shigeru meets with his fiance Kiyo , who is also Goro's sister. He comforts her, telling her that he is sure of Goro's innocence. Inside the mine, three policemen stand guard at the edge of the water, knowing if Goro tries to escape, he will surely come that way . Suddenly, they hear a splash in the flooded mine, and venture into the water. As they wade deeper into the shaft, they get more and more nervous. All of a sudden, one of the policemen begins to scream and then disappears under the water. As the men are tied together, is is not to long before another is pulled under by something beneath the surface. The last policeman quickly unties himself and flees. However, before he can escape, he is cornered and attacked by someone, or something. Soon after, his body, along with the bodies of the other two policemen, are brought up and examined. The doctor announces that they, too, were killed by a sharp object that simply sliced them apart. Later that night, the wife of one of the murdered men runs to Kiyo's house and screams threats at her through the door, as she believes that her brother, Goro, is the killer. Shigeru soon arrives and comforts her, telling her that the officers that were killed were Goro's friends, and that he had no reason to kill them. Someone else, then, killed those men. As the two sit together, the answer to the question of who, or what, murdered the men suddenly reveals itself: a gigantic creature, resembling a gigantic insect larva, enters Kiyo's home, and both Kiyo and Shigeru flee. The police enter the home, but the giant insect forces them to flee. When they regroup, they chase the creature to the top of a hill and open fire with machine guns. The monster launches its self down the hillside and grabs two officers, clutching them in its pincers as it flees. It soon drops them and quickly escapes back into the mine. When the police and Shigeru reach the injured officers, they discover that their wounds match the wounds of the murdered policemen and Yoshi. They have found the killer. Soon after, Shigeru and a group of the metro-police head back into the mine to confront the insect monster and attempt to locate Goro, dead or alive. Unfortunately, as they enter the deepest part of the mine shaft, they discover the butchered body of Goro laying on the floor of the mine. As they approach, the giant insect emerges and chases the men back up the mine shaft. Taking action, Shigeru releases the mine cart, which rolls down the shaft and collides with the insect, crushing and killing it. Shigeru and the others then venture back into the shaft and remove Goro's body. They discover a large hole in the wall that opens up into a large cave. They realize that this is the hole through which the water and the giant insect emerged. As they peek through, they are noticed by not just one, but several more giant insects. However, before the monsters can attack, the ground begins to shake, and the mine begins to cave in. Shigeru is trapped in the cave, and the police can do nothing and the mine collapses. The next day, the police investigate the recent happenings. Dr. Kashiwagi identifies the giant insect as a Meganulon, an ancient species of dragonfly larvae that had lived on the Earth millions of years earlier. As the doctor reveals his findings, an earthquake suddenly strikes the area. Rumors begin to circulate that Mt. Aso, the volcano that eclipses Kitamatsu, might be on the verge of an eruption. When the police arrive at the base of the volcano to investigate the damage caused by the earthquake, they are shocked to discover a man wandering around the epicenter. When they reach him, they discover that it is Shigeru. However, he has received a blow to the head and has lost his memory. He is even unable to recognize Kiyo. The doctors are not optimistic about his chances for recovery, but nevertheless do their best to try to help him any way that they can. Several miles away, in Kyushu, an air base receives an alert from one of their jets. The pilot has observed an unidentified flying object performing impossible maneuvers at supersonic speeds. He is ordered to pursue the object at distance, but as he follows it, the object suddenly changes course and turns around. The object then flies straight towards the jet and destroys it. Soon after, reports from all over the world come in about the UFO. The strange object is observed flying over China, Philippines and Japan, and rumors of a secret military weapon test begin to circulate. Back in Japan, a newly married couple disappear, as well as several heads of cattle around Mt. Aso. When the authorities develop the film from the newlyweds' camera, they discover a photograph of what appears to be a gigantic wing. They match the photo with a drawing of a Pteranodon, an ancient reptile thought to be extinct millions of years earlier. Although the evidence seems to point to the Pteranodon as the culprit, the theory is dismissed as being too far fetched. Meanwhile, Shigeru's treatment is progressing slowly, but no one, especially not Kiyo, is giving up. One day, as Shigeru sits silently in his hospital room, Kiyo shows him the eggs that her pet birds have lain. As one of the eggs hatches, a terrible memory returns to Shigeru: Deep within the mine, Shigeru awoke after the cave in. Suddenly, he realized to his horror that he was surrounded by hundreds of Meganulon. The creatures crawled all around the cave, having survived millions of years underground. Shigeru then looked up and was shocked to see what appeared to be a giant egg sitting right in the middle of the cave. Suddenly, the egg began to stir, and then, all of a sudden, it hatched. From out of the fractured shell emerged a gigantic, winged creature with a sharp beak and a head like a bird of prey. Shigeru watched in horror as the enormous hatchling bent over and began to eat the Meganulon. The monstrous insects that had terrorized the town and had killed his friends were now nothing more than a snack to this new creature. With all of the Meganulon gone, the giant monster spread its wings and roared... Shigeru suddenly awakens, his memory restored. As he recovers from seeing the horrifying vision, Kiyo weeps with joy. Shigeru confirms that the creature he saw did indeed resemble a pteranodon, and that it had eaten all of the Meganulon. He and a group of police and scientists once again descend into the mine and enter the cave where the egg had been. They are able to recover a fragment of the shell before a rock slide forces them to flee back to the surface. In the lab, Dr. Kashiwagi is able to determine the size of the egg and its age: 200 million years old. After amassing the evidence, Kashiwagi calls a meeting with members of the town, along with members of the Japanese Self-Defence Force to communicate his findings. He tells the men that the UFO seen flying all across the world at supersonic speeds is a gigantic pteranodon he has dubbed Rodan. The 50 meter tall monster is capable of flying at extremely fast speeds, which create a sonic boom that more than likely led to the destruction of the jet that had first observed Rodan. Kashiwagi still has no explanation as to how the creature could have transversed the globe so quickly, and why reports of sightings occurred in multiple, distant countries at the same time. As to how Rodan could have resurfaced after millions of years is also a mystery, but Kashiwagi theorizes that nuclear bomb testing, which loosened the Earth and opened cavities to long buried crevices and caves, might be the culprit. However, Kashiwagi admits that this is only a guess. Soon after, Rodan emerges from the ground near Mt. Aso, near where the beast had hatched. The creature takes flight and begins to head for Kyushu, with a squadron of the JASDF hot on his tail. They pursue Rodan over the city, and eventually succeed in forcing him into the river. The flying reptile soon emerges, but his flight speed has been cut by half. Rodan flies over the buildings at Fukuoka, and the sonic wave created in its wake literally tears the structures apart. The flying monster lands in the city and flaps its wings, and the entire city is literally pulled down by its own weight. Fires spread, and the JSDF attempt in vain to fight the creature off. The men, and the machines, are simply blown away. Just when it seems things can't get worse, the JSDF reports that another Rodan has been spotted heading towards the city. With the mystery of the spread out sightings now revealed, the second Rodan now flies over and rips apart the buildings. After leveling the city and leaving the remaining buildings in flames, the monsters Rodan fly away, leaving thousands dead. The JSDF formulate a plan to attack the Rodans. After ascertaining their location at their old nest at the base of Mt. Aso, the military plan to shell the volcano and trigger an eruption that will trap the monsters under the lava and rock. However, Kitamatsu will be completely destroyed in the attack, and the town is forced to evacuate. The army prepares for the attack. Just moments before the strike is to begin, Shigeru looks out the window to see Kiyo climbing up the hill. He runs out to meet her, and she tells him that she has come to be with him. Rather than evacuate, she has risked her life to face the danger with the man she loves. The two leave the area and return to safety, and the military begins its attack. They launch rockets and torpedoes at the mountain, and soon the volcano begins to spew smoke and lava into the sky. One of the Rodans emerges, but is soon overcome by the fumes. As the second Rodan arrives on the scene, the first loses altitude and finally falls into the stream of lava flowing down the side of the volcano. The ancient reptile begins to scream in pain as it burns alive in the lava. The military, Dr. Kashiwagi, Shigeru and Kiyo watch from a safe distance as the still flying Rodan watches its companion die in agony. Suddenly, the second Rodan descends and lands with the first in the lava, and it too begins to burn. Rather then live on alone, the creature will die with its companion. Whether they be siblings or mates, the two Rodans lie dying together in the flowing lava. Kiyo buries her head in Shigeru's shoulder and weeps, and both Kashiwagi and Shigeru watch solemnly as the two monsters, each unwilling to live without the other, die together on the slopes of the erupting volcano.\n","\n","    ### Response: 地中鎌の神霊 地獄の神霊 天地の神霊\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

There are four main story arcs to the film. Three are about the relations of Chow with women that he meets after losing Su Li-Zhen. The first concerns Chow and Wang Jing Wen, the second is about Chow and Bai Ling, and the third is about Chow and a different woman who is also named Su Li-Zhen. The fourth takes place in Chow's mysterious world of 2046 and concerns a Japanese passenger falling in love with an android. Typical of Wong Kar-wai films, the arcs are presented in pieces and in non-chronological order. The approximate order of the arcs is listed below. 2047 arc part I This section is the only part narrated by Chow's fictional character and not Chow himself. Set in the far future, a huge rail network connects the planet. The world is a vast dystopia, and lonely souls all try to reach a mysterious place called 2046 in order to recapture lost loves. In the world of 2046 nothing ever changes, so there is never loss or sadness. No one has ever returned from 2046 except the protagonist, a lonely Japanese man named Tak . As the story begins, Tak is on a long train ride returning from 2046. \"All Memories Are Traces of Tears\" As Chow Mo-Wan's life is revisited, we learn that he is still struggling to get over the loss of his idealised love, Su Li-Zhen. He returns to Hong Kong after being in Singapore for a number of years to try to forget his anguish. To cover up his pain, he becomes a suave ladies' man. Chow attends many lavish parties and beds many women. On Christmas Eve, Chow meets Lulu from the first film  whom he remembers from Singapore, although she has no recollection of him. That night, Chow Mo-wan takes Lulu home as she is quite drunk, but accidentally keeps her room key. As he leaves, he notices that her room number is 2046, the same room number that he and Su Li Zhen had when they conducted their private affair. Upon returning a few days later to return the room key, the landlord informs Chow that the room is not available due to renovations. The landlord offers him the adjacent room 2047. Chow later learns that Lulu was stabbed in the room the night before by a jealous boyfriend. Chow agrees to rent room 2047 in the meantime. After the renovation of room 2046 is complete, the landlord asks Chow if he wants to move in. However, by this time he has gotten used to room 2047 and decides to stay there. The rooms 2046 and 2047 are connected by a common hallway, Chow regularly watches and gets involved with the people that move into 2046. Wang Jing Wen and Wang Jie Wen arc part I The first person that moves next door into 2046 is the landlord's daughter, Wang Jing Wen . Chow spends a good deal of time just observing her from his room. He learns that she has a Japanese boyfriend working in Hong Kong. Unfortunately, the relationship is forbidden by her father. Eventually, Wang breaks up with her boyfriend, then suffers a breakdown and is institutionalised. Afterwards, the next tenant that moves into 2046 is the younger daughter of the landlord, Wang Jie Wen. She is young, attractive, and flirtatious. She frequently tries to seduce him but he refuses each time. A short time later, Chow runs into some financial difficulties, and stops going out. To make some extra money, he starts to write a science fiction series called 2046. The story is set in the distant future, about a group of heart sick individuals looking for love. The only place to find it is at a mysterious location called 2046. Virtually all of the characters in 2046 are based on people that Chow has met, such as Su Li-Zhen, Lulu, or Wang Jing Wen. Whether 2046 is a place, a room, or a state of mind is never explicitly defined. Chow makes the story somewhat bizarre and erotic, and readers seem to take notice. Bai Ling arc part I The third person to move into room 2046 is the coquettish Bai Ling . She wears similar qipao dresses as the original Su Li-Zhen but radiates a much more aggressive sensuality than her. While it is never explicitly stated in the film, it is implied that she is a nightclub girl who occasionally doubles as a high-class prostitute. However, she is intent on finding a long-term relationship. In one instance, when Chow overhears her arguing with a man, Bai tells the man that to continue seeing her, he must end his relationship with the other woman. Chow again spends a lot of time observing her across the thin wall separating rooms 2046 and 2047. On the next Christmas Eve, Bai runs into Chow just after she is dumped by her boyfriend before they are to go to Singapore. Chow suggests that they go for dinner, to which she grudgingly accepts. During dinner, Chow tells Bai about his experiences in Singapore. She is intrigued, and after dinner she agrees to try to form a platonic friendship with him by borrowing time from each other. Their brief friendship does not last however, as they soon develop carnal lust for each other. Not surprisingly, Chow wants to keep the relationship strictly physical; he continues to pick up other prostitutes. To compromise, Bai soon develops a compensation system where he pays her 10 Hong Kong dollars  each time he stays over. However, over time Bai finds that she has feelings for Chow, and she asks him to discontinue seeing other women. Chow refuses and gives a counter offer, the option to be his customer for $10 each night. Bai is crushed and breaks things off with Chow. As a way of revenge, Bai then descends into seeing men exclusively for money, frequently changing partners. A short while later, she moves out of Room 2046. Wang Jing Wen part II After Bai Ling moves out, Wang Jin Wen moves back into 2046 after returning from the mental hospital. She is a shell of a former self, and still very depressed over the loss of her Japanese boyfriend. Her ex writes numerous letters in an attempt to reconcile with her, but she refuses due to her father. Wang passes the time by assisting her father at the hotel. She also starts to spend more and more time with Chow helping him with his writing and editing. At this point, he is regularly publishing chapters of 2046. These scenes are very similar to those in In the Mood for Love when Su Li-Zhen used to help Chow with his writing in their hotel room. Chow remarks that this period in his life is the happiest that he has been after Su Li-Zhen. However, before he realises it, he develops feelings for Wang Jing Wen. He makes some minor attempts to start a romance with her, but nothing develops since she is still very much in love with the Japanese man. One day Wang Jin Wen asks Chow rhetorically if some things in life never change. He answers her by writing a story called 2047. In this story, a Japanese man leaves the world of 2046, but falls in love on the journey home. While he initially tried to base the story on Wang Jing Wen's ex-boyfriend, he realises that the story is ultimately about himself. 2047 arc part II Chow's fictional world is revisited. However, this time it is narrated by Chow himself. Set in the far future, for passengers to reach or leave 2046 they must take a long journey on a vast train network. The main character, Tak  is trying to leave 2046 because he lost the love of his life in that world. As the train travels through the extremely cold sections 1224‚Äì1225, Tak becomes intimate with one of the train's female android assistants  and later falls in love with her. He then asks her numerous times to come with him. However, each time the android does not answer. Tak has heard earlier that excessive operation causes the android's response time to slow down and decides to wait on the train to see if this is the case. He sits quietly on the train, and counts the seconds that go by, hoping the android will decide to leave with him. However, the android still does not respond. Ultimately, Tak realises that it is not a delayed reaction that causes that android not to respond, but that she is in love with someone else and that their relationship is simply not meant to be. With this knowledge, he finally has the strength to leave the train and 2046. Completing the story marks a turning point in Chow's recovery. Wang Jing Wen part III Next Christmas, Chow invites Wang Jing Wen out to dinner. After finding out that she still misses her ex in Japan, he takes her to his office so that she can call him to wish him well. Looking sadly through the window panes as Wang Jing Wen is overjoyed talking to her ex, Chow remarks that in fact Section 1224-1225 from the story are simply the dates for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day when everyone is especially lonely and needs additional love. He goes on to say that while he had feelings for her, and most likely could have taken advantage of the situation  he was happy that in this situation he did the \"right thing\". The call re-ignites the romance. Soon afterward, Wang Jing Wen moves to Japan and gets engaged. A short while later, while still feeling depressed over the loss of Wang Jing Wen, Chow runs into Lulu again as she has a violent confrontation with another woman that is sleeping with her current playboy boyfriend. This incident is identical to one that occurred in the original Days of Being Wild when she confronted the original Su Li-Zhen for sleeping with Yuddy. Chow remarks that Lulu, is likely to forever remain living in the past. However, he then remarks that this is not really a sad thing, as she seems perfectly content to be miserable. The incident strengthens Chow's resolve to get over Su Li-Zhen. Bai Ling arc part II Some time later, Chow gets a call from Bai Ling and the two go out to dinner. This time, Bai looks much less glamorous and more \"run-down\". She informs Chow that she plans to leave for Singapore, and asks him to provide a reference and plane fare. She also asks where he was last Christmas, as she stopped by at that time, and was hoping to see him. In fact, she remarks that she really misses him. It turns out, during last Christmas, Chow had gone back to Singapore in an attempt to find a former lover, another woman named Su Li-Zhen . Su Li-Zhen Arc Chronologically, this arc occurs first in the film. Chow met the second Su Li-Zhen some years back when he first arrived in Singapore. At that time, he was still grieving over losing the original Su Li-Zhen and spending much of his free time in the local casinos. After losing much of his savings, he encounters the second Su Li-Zhen, a mysterious gambler. They become lovers, and he soon wants to know everything about her. But she insists that he beat her in a \"high-card\" draw before she will reveal anything about her past, which he never is able to do. Eventually, she agrees to help him win back his money so that he can return to Hong Kong. When she does so, he prepares to leave, and asks her to go with him. Again, she challenges him to a high-card draw, which he again loses. Knowing little about her, Chow speculates that she, like himself, has a troubled past. Initially heartbroken about this, he remarks that after he completes the story '2047' he finally understands why the second Su Li-Zhen did not go with him, as he would again have tried to recapture the past by looking for elements of the original Su Li-Zhen. When Chow went back to Singapore to visit her the second time, he does not find her. He makes some inquiries as to her whereabouts and speculates that she either returned to Cambodia or was killed. Bai Ling arc part III Shortly after the events of 'Bai Ling arc part II' and the night before she boards a plane for Singapore, Chow again meets Bai Ling for dinner. Bai remarks that, between their two meetings, one of her clients has given her a lot of money and she wants to pay Chow back immediately. He refuses to take the money. Bai insists on paying for dinner, and Chow is stunned when she hands him a stack of money, each $10 bill representing one night they had spent together. Bai tells Chow to pay for dinner with this stack of bills, while unbeknownst to him, she sadly watches behind the restaurant's green window veils. After dinner, Chow walks her back to her apartment. Grasping his hands at the apartment door, she begs him to lend his time to her once more and spend the night. She then asks him \"Why can't it be like it was before?\" He refuses to stay over, even out of pity, coldly stating that that is simply something he would never lend. He exits by jerking his hands away from her and remarks in voiceover that this was the last time he ever saw her. He leaves in a taxi, staring emptily into space, as the camera slowly enters a whispering hole.\n","\n","    ### Response: 2046\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

After a comical exchange with a superior command he gets in touch with by telephone  he, along with some disbanded soldiers, manages to distance the German troops and is thoroughly shocked when, contrary to his plan of finding a higher echelon to which to report, most of the men accept the fact that the war is over for them and \"everybody should just go home\". This reaction at first angers him, but in the end he joins army engineer Ceccarelli  and sergeant Fornaciari  in discarding their uniforms for civilian clothes and heading southwards for a veritable odyssey along the Italian \"boot\", cut in two by German and Allied occupation and wracked by partisan warfare, bloody reprisals, German press-ganging and other perils. The trio meets a band of anti-fascist guerrillas but decline to join them . Later Innocenzi, caught in the \"everybody for himself\" mentality which seems to dominate the landscape, succumbs to the temptation of abandoning his mates to help a sultry black marketeer smuggle a load of flour to Rome, as she needs a driver and does not have room for any other passengers. The deal goes awry due to a mechanical failure in a rubble-strewn town where the famished populace plunders the lorry, and after some recriminations and a brief scuffle, Innocenzi rejoins his companions. They witness the killing of a rookie, a naive Italian soldier who tried to protect a Jewish girl during a German roundup; finally they manage to reach Fornaciari's rural home. The former sergeant is delighted of having returned to his young wife, children and old father and offers Innocenzi and Ceccarelli hospitality for the night; his wife reveals that the family has been hiding a former U.S. POW  who escaped from the Folpiano prison camp to protect him from the fascist militia patrols and Fornaciari, albeit grudgingly, accepts to keep protecting him. After a darkly humorous polenta dinner  they all go to sleep but a nighttime fascist patrol breaks in and manages to find the Allied serviceman. Amidst the children's cries and his wife's weeping, Fornaciari is hauled away toward a grim fate, and Ceccarelli and Innocenzi flee the premises without being able to help. The couple manages to reach Littoria , where Innocenzi's widowed father, , lives alone and offers Ceccarelli  to stay a few days before resuming his travel south. Innocenzi is shocked when his father introduces him to a fascist party leader who is recruiting men for the army of the Repubblica Sociale Italiana, the fascist puppet state instituted by the Germans after the liberation of Benito Mussolini from his Gran Sasso exile. His father angrily responds to his objections, citing the misery he's living in and all the sacrifices he incurred to allow make him to study and become an army officer; a deep rift is created between father and son, and Innocenzi asks Ceccarelli to take him south to Naples as well, to which the engineer happily consents. However Naples is in grimmer conditions than Rome, directly on the line of fire after the Allied landing at Salerno, barely kept under control by brutal German detachments who round up able-bodied men to send them to Germany as slave workers. To reach the city the duo passes through a roadblock manned by fanatical, hungry fascists; Ceccarelli, generously chooses to sacrifice a suitcase of delicacies he was meant to deliver to the wife of his Commanding Officer . The situation  causes Innocenzi much panic, having had raided the case during a night-time train trip and substituting the goods with stones and newspaper sheets; he urges his companion to run away before the fascists open it, but they are unsuccessful. Innocenzi and Ceccarelli are pressed in an Organisation Todt rubble-clearing chain gang and manage to escape when the city insurges against the occupiers in the Four days of Naples. Desperately trying to reach his home, which is just a few blocks away, Ceccarelli is cut down in a hail of German fire, at which time Innocenzi decides that the real war to be waged is that against the Nazi occupiers and joins an insurgent band offering to man the Breda M 37 machine gun they have captured but cannot operate. With a renewed stern look on his face, Innocenzi opens fire against the Germans, bringing the movie to a close.\n","\n","    ### Response: 8 September 1943\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

The owner decides to get Benjamin, the black manager of the club, to talk to Elsie and try to persuade her to cooperate. Benjamin refuses and quits his job. Benjamin tells Elsie of his conversation with the owner and persuades Elsie to stay on because she is popular and can make a lot of money, but he warns her to be careful. Elsie stays, but still refuses to date the customers. Later, the owner hires John and Clyde, Elsie's uncles, to replace Benjamin. One evening, after the club closes, Elsie goes home and finds at her horror that her aunt, who lives with her, is dead. She calls the police and they discover that her aunt has been murdered by a single blow in the head. The police question Elsie and do not believe her story, so they arrest her for the death of her aunt. John and Clyde testify that they saw Elsie on the night of the murder leaving the club for a short time and later returning. Mrs. Green, the sister of Clyde and John, tells the police that Elsie bought a large life insurance policy on her aunt, with herself as the beneficiary. With this evidence, Elsie is convicted of the crime and sent to prison. Benjamin, who has now become a detective on the police force, and Detective Wanzer, who is a close friend of Elsie's, do not believe that she is guilty and set out to find the real killer. After some investigation, they learn that Mrs. Green's husband was actually in love with Elsie's aunt. With jealousy as a possible motive, Benjamin and Wanzer now suspect that Mrs. Green and her two sons are connected with the crime. One night they confront John and accuse him of the murder. John refuses to confess, so Benjamin and Wanzer take him to Tolston's Castle, which is supposed to be haunted. There they threaten to tie him up and leave him at the mercy of the ghosts. Terrified, John decides to tell all. He reveals the story of his sister's family, and tells them how her husband was tricked into marrying her. He told them that Mrs. Green's husband was in love with Elsie's aunt when they lived in the South. The husband, after realizing the trick, ran north, but Mrs. Green pursued him, and her two brothers threatened him to get back together with her. Although he stayed at home after that, Mrs. Green's husband continued to see Elsie's aunt and threatened to leave Mrs. Green. John continues, and admits that he and Clyde lied about seeing Elsie leave the club on the night of the murder. Furthermore, he tells that early in the evening on the night of the murder Mrs. Green found a note left by her husband. The note stated that, out of despair, he had decided to kill Elsie's aunt and then take his own life by jumping off a bridge into the river. John also relates that it was Mrs. Green's plan to frame Elsie for the crime. The police recover Mrs. Green's husband's body from the river, verifying John's story. On this new evidence, Elsie is granted a pardon by the Governor and released from prison. Out of deep gratitude and love, Elsie marries Benjamin, who has been in love with her all the time.Sampson, Henry T.

The conquest largely removed the native  ruling class, replacing it with a foreign, French-speaking monarchy, aristocracy, and clerical hierarchy. The story line monitors the transformation of Thomas Becket, portrayed, following the play, as a Saxon prot√©g√© and facilitator to the carousing King Henry, into a man who continually invokes the \"honor of God\". Henry appoints Becket as Archbishop of Canterbury in order to have a close confidant in this position that he could completely control. Instead, Becket becomes a major thorn in his side in a jurisdictional dispute. Much of the plot concerns Henry, the \"perennial adolescent\" as described by the Bishop of London, who finds his duties as king and his stale arranged marriage to be oppressive. Early in the film, we see him escaping them through drunken forays onto the hunting grounds and local brothels. He is increasingly dependent on Becket, a Saxon commoner, who arranges these debaucheries when he is not busy running Henry's court. This foments great resentment on the part of Henry's Norman noblemen, who distrust and envy this Saxon upstart, as well as the queen and queen mother, who see Becket as an unnatural and unseemly influence upon the royal personage. Henry finds himself in continuous conflict with the elderly Archbishop of Canterbury, who opposes the taxation of Church property in order to support Henry's military campaigns in France . During one of his campaigns in coastal France, he receives word that the old bishop has \"gone to God's bosom\". In a burst of inspiration, Henry exercises his prerogative to pick the next Archbishop and informs an astonished Becket that he is the royal choice. Shortly thereafter, Becket sides with the Church, throwing Henry into a fury. One of the main bones of contention is Thomas' excommunication of Lord Gilbert, one of Henry's most loyal stalwarts, for seizing and ordering the killing of a priest who had been accused of sexual indiscretions with a young girl, before the priest can even be handed over for ecclesiastical trial. Gilbert then refuses to acknowledge his transgressions and seek absolution. The King has a dramatic secret meeting with the Bishop of London in his cathedral . He lays out his plan to remove the troublesome cleric through scandal and innuendo which the position-conscious Bishop of London quickly agrees to . These attempts fall flat when Becket, in full ecclesiastic garb, confronts his accusers outside the rectory and routs them causing Henry to laugh and bitterly note the irony of it all, \"Becket is the only intelligent man in my entire kingdom...and he is against me!\" Becket escapes to France where he encounters the conniving yet sympathetic King Louis . King Louis sees in Becket a means by which he can further his favorite pastime, tormenting the arrogant English. Becket gets to Rome, where he begs the Holy Pontiff to allow him to renounce his position and retire to a monastery as an ordinary priest. The Vatican is a hotbed of intrigue and political jockeying. The Pope reminds Becket that he has an obligation as a matter of principle to return to England and take a stand against civil interference in Church matters. Becket yields to this decision and asks Louis to arrange a meeting with Henry on the beaches at Normandy. Henry asks Becket whether or not he loved him and Becket replied that he loved Henry to the best of his ability. A shaky truce is declared and Becket is allowed to return to England. The remainder of the film shows Henry rapidly sinking into drunken fixation over Becket and his perceived betrayal. The barons worsen his mood by pointing out that Becket has become a folk hero among the vanquished Saxons who are ever restive and resentful of their Norman conquerors. There are comical fights between Henry and his frumpy consort, Eleanor of Aquitaine, his dimwitted son/heir apparent, and his cold-blooded mother, who repeatedly reminds her son that his father would have quickly had someone like Becket done away with for the sake of the realm. During one of his drunken rages he asks \"Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest?\" His faithful barons hear this and proceed quickly to Canterbury, where they put Thomas and his Saxon deputy, Brother John, to the sword. A badly shaken Henry then undergoes a penance by whipping at the hands of Saxon monks. The film concludes with Henry, fresh from his whipping, publicly proclaiming Thomas Becket a saint and that the ones who had killed him will be justly punished.\n","\n","    ### Response:  Becket\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

His mother Grace  and his father Allen  get an unexpected visitor knocking at their door; it turns out to be a young woman called Rose , who is pregnant with Bennett's child. As the story develops Bennett's younger brother Ryan is introduced and he is grieving the fact he did not say a final good bye to his brother. One sees the true relationships of the family as the story comes together, Grace waits at the bed of Jordan Walker, the man driving the truck which collided with Bennett's car in the crash. She is waiting for his wake so she can ask him what her son's final 17 minutes were. After a while, she finds out the truth but is disappointed in what she hears. In the last moments, Bennett was not calling his mothers name, he was calling to Rose asking the other wounded passenger Walker to make sure that she was safe. Allen hires a cleaner to clean the house, but when Grace finds out she is terribly angry, claiming their son has been washed away. Allen then appears to be having a heart attack whilst Grace carries on shouting until she realises what the matter is. At the hospital bed, shortly after Grace returns from finding out the truth about Bennett, Allen breaks down crying claiming to be holding in all his grief and upset, he claims he could have done something to prevent the crash and later his son's death. Rose, meanwhile, has overheard Grace saying she should have died and not Bennett and so she leaves and seeks the help of her mother. She soon realises that all her mother is bothered about was trying to get money from the Brewers, claiming it will help her. The Brewers try to find Rose and they find her in labour and persuade her to go to the hospital and, while in the car on the way, she demands to know everything about Bennett she did not already know.

Though there is a nod to the classic Holmes in a scene where Holmes and Watson are leaving 221b Baker Street, and Holmes picks up his deerstalker. Watson protests, and Holmes reluctantly puts on a fedora instead. Holmes is called into the \"Inner Council\" of British Intelligence by Sir Evan Barham ([[Reginald Denny , to assist in stopping Nazi saboteurs operating in Britain, whose activities are announced in advance in radio broadcasts by \"The Voice of Terror\". Gavin ([[Robert Barron , one of Holmes's operatives, is killed with a German dagger in his back. Before he dies, Gavin utters the word \"Christopher.\" Later, Holmes and Watson go to the Limehouse district of London, where they meet with Gavin's wife Kitty . Holmes tells the council that, through the use of an oscilloscope to carefully analyze and compare sound wave patterns from radio broadcasts of live vs. pre-recorded voices, he has determined that \"The Voice of Terror\" is actually recorded on phonograph records in England, but broadcast from Germany. Using a tip from Kitty, Holmes and Watson go to the old Christopher Docks, where they are followed by Sir Anthony Lloyd  of the council. The three men are captured by a group of Nazi spies led by a man named Meade , although Meade manages to escape through a trap door to a waiting speedboat. Kitty pretends to be a thief on the run and joins Meade. She finds out that Meade plans to go to Sir Evan's country estate that night. There Holmes and Sir Evan watch a German plane attempt to land, but gunshots fired by Sir Evan disrupt the Nazi rendezvous, all the while Meade hides in the dark. After one of Holmes informants traces Meade and Kitty to the south coast of England, Holmes forces the council to go there with him. With the support of British troopers, Holmes captures Meade and a group of German soldiers stationed in an abandoned church. There he reveals the true identity of \"The Voice of Terror\" as Sir Evan Barham, who happens to be an impostor. Holmes then reveals that in World War I, the real Barham was a prisoner in a German war camp and had an uncanny resemblance to a Heinrich Von Bork, a member of the German Secret Service; one day the real Barham was taken out executed; the gentleman who called Holmes into the case was Von Bork himself who had posing as Barham for 24 years; Holmes then adds that Barham had no immediate family, so his private life was well studied by Von Bork, who also studied at Oxford and had knowledge of the English language and manners. So, with a little help of plastic surgery, not to mention the resemblance to Barham in the first place, the deception was carried out thoroughly. Holmes also concludes that the real Sir Evan Barham carried a scar from childhood, the one Von Bork carried from plastic surgery was approximately 20 years old - the clue that gave away the fact that he was an impostor. Holmes then informs the spies that the German invasion force has been destroyed. The angry Meade shoots and fatally wounds Kitty, but is killed himself as he attempts to escape. The Council stand around the murdered Kitty and swear that her heroic death will not be in vain. The film ends with a direct quote from \"His Last Bow\": :Watson: It's a lovely morning, Holmes. :Holmes: There's an East wind coming, Watson. :Watson: I don't think so. Looks like another warm day. :Holmes: Good old Watson. The one fixed point in a changing age. But there's an East wind coming all the same. Such a wind as never blew on England yet. It will be cold and bitter, Watson, and a good many of us may wither before its blast. But it's God's own wind none the less. And a greener, better, stronger land will be in the sunshine when the wind is cleared.Davies, David Stuart, Holmes of the Movies  ISBN 450 03358 9\n","\n","    ### Response:  The Spider Woman\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

She works at Rio de Janeiro's Central Station, writing letters for illiterate customers, in order to make ends meet. She can be impatient with her customers and sometimes does not mail the letters she writes, putting them in a drawer or even tearing them up. Josu√© is a poor 9-year-old boy who has never met his father, but hopes to do so. His mother sends letters to his father through Dora, saying that she hopes to reunite with him soon, but when she is killed in a bus accident just outside the train station, the boy is left homeless. Dora takes him in and traffics him to a corrupt couple, but she is made to feel guilty by her neighbor and friend Irene and later steals him back. Dora is initially reluctant to be responsible for the boy, but ends up deciding to take a trip with him to Northeast Brazil in order to find his father's house and leave him there. Dora tries to leave Josu√© on the bus, but he follows her, forgetting his backpack containing Dora's money. Penniless, they are picked up by a kind, Evangelical truck driver who abandons them when Dora encourages him to drink beer and then grows too friendly. Dora trades her watch for a ride to Bom Jesus on the back of a truck. They find his father's address in Bom Jesus, but the current residents say that Jesus won a house in the lottery, and now lives in the new settlements, adding that he lost the house and money through drinking. With no money, Josu√© saves them from destitution by suggesting Dora write letters for the pilgrims who have arrived in Bom Jesus for a massive pilgrimage. This time she posts the letters. They take the bus to the settlements, but when they locate the address they have for Josu√©'s father, they are told by the new residents that he no longer lives there and has disappeared. Josu√© tells Dora that he will wait for him, but Dora invites him to live with her. She calls Irene in Rio and asks her to sell her refrigerator, sofa and television. She says that she will call when she gets settled somewhere. After she hangs up, she learns that there are no buses leaving until the next morning. Isa√≠as, one of Josu√©'s half-brothers, is working on a roof next to the bus stop, and learns that they are looking for his father. After introducing himself, Dora says that she is a friend of his father and was in the area. Isa√≠as insists that she and Josu√©, who, suspicious of the stranger, has introduced himself as Geraldo, come to dinner. They return to his house, where they meet Mois√©s, the other half-brother. Later, Isa√≠as explains to Dora that their father married Ana, who he doesn't know is Josu√©'s mother, after their mother died, and that nine years ago, while pregnant, Ana left her drunken lover for Rio and never returned. Isa√≠as asks Dora to read a letter his father wrote to Ana when he disappeared, six months ago, in case she returned. In the letter, the boys' father explains that he has gone to Rio to find Ana and the son he has never met. He promises to return, asks her to wait for him, and says they can all be together -- himself, Ana, Isa√≠as and Mois√©s. At this point Dora pauses, looks at Josu√© and says, \"and Josu√©, whom I can't wait to meet.\" Isa√≠as and Josu√© both say that he will return, but Mois√©s doesn't think so. The next morning, while the sons sleep, Dora sneaks out to catch the bus for Rio. She first leaves beside the letter from Jesus the one from Ana to Jesus, the one Dora carried with her from the Central Station but never mailed, expressing Ana's wish for the family to be reunited. Josu√© wakes up too late to prevent her departure. Dora writes a letter to Josu√© on the bus.

Pilot Bill Brooks , co-pilot Joe , and steward Larry  comprise the crew. A fierce nighttime storm buffets their airliner. A gas cylinder comes loose and is thrown against the door, forcing it open; Larry falls out to his death. An engine fails and the pilots are forced to crash-land in the jungle. In the morning, the professor recognizes the plants of the Amazon rainforest. The aircraft has been blown far south of where rescuers would search, and the nearest civilization is across the mountains; but there is water where they are, and enough fruit and game to live on. Weeks go by while Bill and Joe struggle to repair the damaged aircraft, and the others clear a runway. The experience changes everyone. The Spenglers rediscover their love for each other. Bill warms to an appreciative Peggy, although she tells him about her past. Judson goes to pieces, staying drunk much of the time, while Alice toughens up, and begins to feel attracted to Joe. The biggest change is in Vasquez. Seeing how well most of the group have coped with their situation, he reconsiders his radical beliefs. On the 23rd day, Crimp disappears. It is Tommy who eventually discovers him. When Peggy and Pete go looking for the boy, he leads them to the body, which has a poison dart in it. Pete orders Peggy to take Tommy to safety while he covers their retreat, and is also killed by the unseen natives. The remaining survivors board the now-repaired aircraft, but as the engines rev up, an oil leak develops. Bill and Joe patch it, but realize that it will fail some time after takeoff, leaving only one working engine. As a result, the aircraft can only carry four adults and Tommy across the mountains. As everyone tries to decide how to choose who will stay and who will face the hostile natives, Vasquez suddenly grabs a gun and announces that, since he is doomed no matter what, he is the only one without bias and will make the decisions. He will think about it until the plane is ready. While thinking, he is approached by Professor Spengler, who says he and his wife have lived their lives and should stay, and by Judson, who tries to bribe Vasquez by offering to pay for a top lawyer. When the aircraft is ready, Vasquez announces that both pilots and both of the younger women will go along with Tommy. Judson attacks him and Vasquez shoots him dead. The aircraft takes off, leaving Vasquez and the Spenglers. As the natives approach, Professor Spengler quietly informs Vasquez that must not be taken alive, as they will be tortured. Vasquez lies to him, telling him that there are three bullets left. He kills the couple with his last two bullets, and waits for his grisly fate.\n","\n","    ### Response: 30,000 Feet in the Air\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

Other members of the commune include Johnny Red, a '60s radical who constantly refers to Sweden as an ideal society; Gin, Red's hippie girlfriend; Karla, a bisexual with issues of misandry; Sweeny, a promiscuous DJ who worked at a local record store; Double D , an unintelligent but good hearted commune member, and Puck's best friend; and \"The Trolls,\" a ragtag group of \"crunchy types\" who lived in tents in the backyard of the house and home schooled about a dozen children. The commune, referred to as \"Sam,\" is funded by a collective Anarchist bookstore, where the members take turns operating the front desk. Throughout the movie this group is referred to as \"The Family,\" and their way of life is described as peaceful and happy, until the day Johnny Black, a mysterious, militant nihilist with a forceful personality, appears. Johnny Black shares much of the rebellious philosophy of \"the family\" when he shows up, however he disrespects what he sees as the narrow minded and shortsighted protest tactics Johnny Red espouses. However, politically weak within the framework of the Family, Black cannot challenge Red's authority for the time being. Frustrated and unhappy with his social life and lack of direction, Puck seeks a girlfriend. He eventually meets a young woman at a night club, Jody, who he learns is a young Republican college student. However, when his new observations of Jody's political beliefs and academic success causes him greater internal conflict and personal embarrassment, Puck decides to temporarily leave the Family and ventures out to find a new job and home. Still unhappy and directionless, Puck opts to return to the Family.  In the time that has transpired in Puck's absence, Black's influence over the family has steadily grown. Encouraging the group to forge alliances with \"like-minded\" organizations. Over time, Black undergoes a more militant shift in personality. At a meeting for a planned protest demonstration against a petrochemical plant, Black denounces the peaceful, non-violent approach most of the attendants support, and presents two tools to be used in their attack on the plant: semtex and The Anarchist Cookbook. Johnny Red describes the book as \"a relic from the past... it taught you how to make bombs, how to make drugs... and it meant something once.\" He also accurately mentions that the author, William Powell, has disavowed the book. He continues, commenting, \"the book's not the problem. The problem is the kind of people who look to it for answers.\" A few days afterward, Johnny Black discovers Red's private journal, in which he admits to being sexually attracted to young boys. He places this in the open for Gin to discover, and after reading a passage in which Red admits to his pedophilia, she dumps him. Following this, Red's personality becomes more anxious and submissive to Black. One day, while carrying science kits, Puck, Double D, and Sweeney are approached by a police officer who randomly stops them and requests to inspect their contents. After complying, they receive a ride from the officer to Sam, explaining that their run down house is in fact an orphanage the kits are intended for. The officer decides to visit the building, and enters to discover Karla in the midst of using cocaine with Johnny Black. The entire group, except for Johnny Red, is promptly arrested and brought to trial, the presiding judge ironically being a spurned, former lover of Karla. The flop house, Sam, is shut down by the city; Johnny Black receives time at a medium security prison, with the possibility for parole in four months; Sweeney and Double D each receive 250 hours of community service; Karla, aside from being insulted by the judge, is made to receive a mandatory psychiatric evaluation; and Puck is placed under house arrest for 180 days, and forced to move into his parent's home in the city of Plano, Texas. Puck chafes in his suburban life, but comes to accept it with Jody's encouragement, until Johnny Black is paroled after four months. Black appears in Puck's apartment and easily convinces Puck to remove the ankle bracelet that tracks him and rejoin the Family.  Puck soon discovers that Karla, Sweeney, and Double D are all suffering from drug addiction, and have relocated to a new squat which they name \"Son of Sam\". The next stage of Johnny Black's strategy for his movement is the creation of a coalition of organizations which agree with any facet of his goals. However, these include extremist, conservative groups, such as neo-nazis and militia men. Black offers The Anarchist Cookbook as an instructional booklet to the other groups, while they pledge to offer various arms and explosives, and plans a \"joint mission\" to attack a local university. Puck attempts to leave the organization, but is under constant surveillance. He commits to remaining in the group, so as to watch over Double D, for whom he feels responsible. This situation eventually ends in tragedy when Double D overdoses on diazepam. Puck finally resolves to escape from the group and prevent the mission, and convinces a sober Sweeney and Johnny Red to help. Together, they devise a plan to intoxicate the extremist group members with pancakes laced with the very drugs Double D overdosed on. Once the entire organization is unconscious, the surviving members of the Family split up. Alone, Puck decides that once the group awakens he'd be in immediate danger, and so decides to report the organization and cooperate fully with the FBI, for which he receives a reward of $200,000. Immediately afterward, Puck considers his options and realizing that he now has the money and time to commit to his future, decides to take Jody's advice and return to college. Alone, he begins to hitchhike to California to join Jody as she interns at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. Receiving a ride from a truck driver, Puck is asked what his name is, and after some internal thinking, decides to accept his legal name and chosen name together: \"Peter Puck.\" The final monologue by Puck meditates over his new perspective on life and his personal philosophy, and renounces the concept of \"freedom without responsibility,\" which contrasts with his idealistic opening-sequence monologue.\n","\n","    ### Response: 60 Degrees of Separation\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

Each Marine is not only experienced but has a special skill with the exception of the radio operator, PFC Grenier . Grenier, an air crew radioman with only six months in the Corps is taken off the PBY's air crew when the original radio operator suddenly became medically unfit for the mission. He is given the sick Marine's radio and camouflage jacket to carry on his first ground combat mission. He serves as a narrator to the audience. After meeting up with their guide , the patrol commander Captain Alonzo Davis  is killed while ambushing a small group of Japanese soldiers, and First Sergeant Corey  takes command. Pvt. George George and Pfc. Henry Reynolds are killed while taking out a Japanese tank and patrol. And Cpl. Stanley Parrish is killed by a guerrilla trap soon after. As they walk on, Amado is shot by a Japanese officer while scaling a small hill. The marines let him die to keep their presence secret. Grenier is eventually told by Gunnery Sergeant Wartell  that they were sent to recover some important information from a contact in a tea house whose radio was destroyed, thus explaining the radio's importance to the mission. Grenier's inexperience and incompetence arouses anger amongst Corey and the other members of the patrol. His only friend is easy going but professional Gunnery Sergeant Wartell who acts as a mediator between the hard no nonsense 1st Sgt Corey and Grenier, explaining each one to the other and the audience. Rooney provides the only comedy relief in the film when his character is captured and interrogated by a group of careless Japanese soldiers. The surviving squad members eventually arrive at the tea house but, unfortunately, Amado was the one who was supposed to meet the contact as he was the only Filipino in the group. Desperate, the group sends Corey to met the contact, Miyazaki a Filipino-American woman from Long Beach, California. While sneaking out of the camp with Miyazaki, Corey crashes into a waiter and the two run across a straw bridge then blow it up with a grenade, escaping from the soldiers. Meanwhile, a large skirmish with a Japanese patrol has killed Cpl. Alvin Ross and Platoon Sergeant William Maccone, shot the radio up beyond repair, and wounded Gunnery Sergeant Wartell. Wartell, knowing he will slow the survivors down, tells the reluctant Corey to leave him behind. When they leave, he plants grenades under himself and is captured by the Japanese soldiers. After toying with them a bit during his interrogation he sets off the grenades, taking them all out in the blast, and leaving Corey and Grenier the only surviving marines. The explosion is heard by the survivors and they sadly track on. Corey and Grenier learn from Miyazaki that the Japanese are expecting the invasion fleet and have placed a mine field powerful enough to destroy the entire fleet in the water around the invasion sites. Arriving at a friendly Filipino village, Corey and Grenier are able to escape a Japanese patrol by boat. But Miyazaki is killed by an officer she seduced to buy the guys some time. At last discovering the principles of mission accomplishment, altruism, and self sacrifice through observation, Grenier becomes a squared away Marine. He and his First Sergeant infiltrate the enemy base to remotely detonate the minefield with the Japanese radio transmitter. As Corey provides a one man army diversion, Grenier is able to detonate the mines by radio control. Grenier then steals a radio and goes to tell Corey of their success, only to find Corey dead of blood loss from wounds he got while holding off the Japanese. Grenier escapes to the coast and radios for pick up. Leaving him the sole survivor of the mission.

Coe is found dead the next morning in his bedroom, locked from the inside. District Attorney Markham , Police Sergeant Heath  and everyone else assume it was suicide since he was shot through the head and was found holding a pistol. However, Vance is not convinced. He soon finds evidence that shows that Coe was murdered. Coroner Dr. Doremus  determines the victim died of a stab wound. There is no shortage of suspects; Coe was very much disliked. His niece Hilda Lake  resented her uncle's tight control of her finances and jealousy of any men who showed interest in her. Her boyfriend, Sir Thomas MacDonald , suspected Coe of killing his dog to ensure winning the competition. Raymond Wrede , the dead man's secretary, was in love with Miss Lake, but had been laughed at when he sought Coe's support. Coe's next door neighbor and lover Doris Delafield  had been cheating on him with Eduardo Grassi . When Coe found out, he canceled a contract to sell his collection of Chinese artworks to the Milan museum for which Grassi worked. Liang , the cook, had worked long, hard and illegally to help Coe amass his collection. He warned his employer against the proposed sale and was fired as a result. Even Coe's own brother Brisbane ([[Frank Conroy  made it clear that he despised him. Finally Gamble , the head servant, had concealed his criminal past. Brisbane Coe becomes Vance's prime suspect. His alibi of taking a train at the time of the murder is disproved. However, when he is found dead in a closet, Vance is both puzzled and enlightened. Among Brisbane's effects, Vance finds a book titled Unsolved Murders; a bookmarked page details a method of using string to lock a door through the keyhole without leaving a trace. Part of the mystery is solved. Later, an attempt is made on the life of Sir Thomas using the same dagger used to kill Coe. Finally, a Doberman Pinscher belonging to Miss Delafield is found seriously injured, apparently struck with a fireside poker. From these and other clues, Vance finally solves the crime. It turns out that two men had sought Coe's life that night. The successful murderer had struggled with Coe, stabbed him, and left him apparently dead. However, Coe awakened soon after. Too dazed to recall the fight and notice that he was mortally wounded, he went upstairs to his bedroom and opened his window before dying. Brisbane entered the chamber, saw his brother apparently asleep in his chair. He shot the corpse and arranged the scene to look like a suicide. However, downstairs he ran into the actual killer, who had seen that Archer Coe was still alive and came back to finish the job. In the darkness, he mistook Brisbane for Archer and killed the wrong man. Delafield's dog then wandered in, attracted by the commotion, and attacked the murderer. While sure of the killer's identity, Vance has no proof. He therefore arranges for Sir Thomas and Wrede to quarrel over Hilda Lake. When Wrede instinctively reaches for the poker to strike his rival, the healed Doberman which Vance had brought recognizes its attacker and leaps on him. Wrede confesses he became enraged when Coe refused to assist his courtship of Miss Lake, precipitating the initial stabbing.\n","\n","    ### Response: 6,1\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

They both have a very low opinion of the opposite sex, and staunchly believe marriage is not the way to go for the two newlyweds, whom they try to discourage from proceeding further. Simrita convinces Kamini to test out her theory that men are after only one thing, by forcing Lucky to delay their marriage vows for three months. She is sure, Lucky will not be able to do so and this will prove to Kamini that Lucky is just another low-class male, like all others, and her claims of him being different than most men are unfounded. Viraj, upon hearing about this new development, tries to do the exact opposite. This results in a hilarious scene at a local disco bar, where Viraj lures Kamini with the hope of her finding Lucky with a \"girlfriend\" that he has planted in the lap of Lucky in order to make Kamini jealous. The plan backfires and Kamini and Lucky end up in divorce court where the judge puts them on a three month probation and marriage counselling. Meanwhile, Simrita and Viraj keep bumping into each other when they both travel to Italy independently; the former to make some quick cash as a model to pay for her medical bills, and the latter, with Lucky, to chill out and take a vacation from all of the marital stress Lucky has been facing back home. Upon returning home, Simrita is given a watch pendant by her Dolly Aunty  to wear as a good luck charm. The pendant hangs from a bracelet on her wrist. Viraj gets seriously hurt in an accident at work and is brought for emergency surgery to the hospital where Simrita is an intern. Much to each other's irritation, Simrita is given the charge to perform surgery on Viraj. After the surgery, while looking at the X-rays, she is horrified to discover that the watch on her wrist has accidentally ended up in Viraj's stomach. Simrita tries various ways of getting the watch out. During one such process, which fails, it becomes clear that Simrita is bitter about her perceived unfaithfulness of the two most prominent men from her childhood: her divorced father and her elder sister's ex-husband. By this time, Viraj is secretly beginning to fall in love with Simrita. Several days later, Simrita is successful in removing the watch from Viraj's stomach. Following the surgery, Viraj overhears the truth and leaves. Several days later, he proposes to Denise Richards in an attempt to forget about Simrita. Upon realizing her mistake, Simrita helps Lucky and Kamini reconcile and decides to confess her love for Viraj at the wedding ceremony. At first, Denise is upset but then tells Viraj to go to Simrita. The two embrace and go off together in the car sharing a few passionate kisses.\n","\n","    ### Response: 3 Idiots\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

Kama is one of the six moral weaknesses: kama , krodha , lobha , moha , madha  and matsara . Jayanthi, who somehow manages to carry herself despite being a little too well-fed, begins with a song expressing pangs of separation with her soldier-husband. The song -- 'Viraha,' is a classic in Kannada movie lore, and is quite often interjected in banter to express estrangement. As the song ends with the return of her husband, it becomes evident that the war has not just crippled his leg. Subsequently, the trauma of a marriage bereft of a physical relationship is portrayed in sing-song histrionics prevalent in movies of this period. The introduction of the brash, loud, motorbike-riding Nanjunda, infuses enthusiasm into a hitherto hurried and jarring narrative. Nanjunda, a fresh college graduate, also happens to be the Captain's neighbor. A word on topography and co-ordinates is in order here. The movie appears to be depicting Kodagu  as inferred by the frequently portrayed undulating hills, and typical Kodava dresses. The Captain and Nanjunda, own adjoining estates in this region. Nanjunda is on a visit, and seems to indulge in little but bike-riding and indolence. His dad's estate is managed by his uncle, Shivaram, another stentorian voice that strains the eardrums. The next part is the heart of the movie where Kanagal shines through with his trademark symbolism and narrative restraint. Many sequences are edited to be suggestive but incomplete, leaving just enough room to make it imaginative, but not enough to make vague. Nanjunda and the couple  move from being well-acquainted to being cosy friends through card-games and raucous, if unnecessary, laughter. And then it happens. Madhavi and Nanjunda embark on a picnic to Edakallu gudda , a desolate hilltop that houses a cavern, and has a little pond in it to boot. Though merely playful to begin with, proximity and solitude combine to tempt them, and Madhavi, in a moment of weakness falls prey to lust. If Nanjunds seduced her has no objective answer. Kanagal's subsequent portrayal of the uneasy relationship between Nanjunda and Madhavi deserves merit for its transitional nature. Nanjunda's infatuation in the immediate aftermath of the their first corporeal encounter, Madhavi's tortured complaisance in furthering the passion, till a fog of guilt and doom descends on her, are excellent in injecting a dash of reality. As the confused relationship teeters, a twist arrives in the form of Devaki, Madhavi's sister who arrives to stay with her sister. Nanjunda is immediately enamoured, and switched allegiance in a trice. But Devaki proves a harder nut to crack, and his advances are spurned with minimal effort. As a hapless onlooker to this courtship, Madhavi's welling emotions brimmeth over, adding anger and betrayal to guilt and remorse. Meanwhile, Nanjunda achieves a breakthrough as he machinates a picnic to, where else‚ÄîEdakallu gudda, with Devaki. He isn't as lucky this time. As Nanjunda gets more desperate in wooing Devaki, and Madhavi gets even more desperate in protecting her sister, things come to a head. The cat is let out of the bag in the form of too audible a meow emanating from Nanjunda's bedroom -- that Madhavi creates and  Devaki overhears. An interspersed song with the two sisters as muses, is pleasant for its departure from being a typical male-female duet. The climax is best left to the viewer.\n","\n","    ### Response: ಅದ್ದಕಲ್ಲು ಗುಡ್ದ\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

Jesuit missionaries are trying to encourage the local Algonquin Indians to embrace Christianity, with thus far only limited results. Samuel de Champlain, founder of the settlement, sends Father LaForgue, a young Jesuit priest, to find a distant Catholic mission in a Huron village. LaForgue is accompanied on his journey by a non-Jesuit assistant, Daniel, and a group of Algonquin Indians whom Champlain has ordered to guide him to the Huron village. This group includes Chomina  - an older, experienced traveller who has clairvoyant dreams; his wife ; and Annuka , their daughter. As they journey across the lakes and forests, Daniel and Annuka fall in love, to the discomfort of the celibate LaForgue. The group meet with a band of Montagnais Indians who have never met Frenchmen before. The Montagnais shaman is suspicious  of LaForgue's influence over the Algonquins. He accuses him of being a devil. He encourages Chomina and the other Algonquins to abandon the two Frenchmen and travel instead to a winter hunting lodge. This they do, paddling away from the Frenchmen. LaForgue accepts his fate, but Daniel is determined to stay with Annuka and follows the Indians as they march across the forest. When one Indian tries to shoot Daniel, Chomina is consumed by guilt at having betrayed Champlain's trust. He and a few other members of the Algonquin tribe return with Daniel to try to find LaForgue. As they recover LaForgue, a party of Iroquois attacks them, killing Chomina's wife and taking the rest captive. They are taken to an Iroquois fortress, where they are beaten and told they will be slowly tortured to death, only after Chomina's young son is killed before his eyes. Annuka helps them escape by seducing a guard with sex. Chomina, dying of a wound from his capture, freezes to death in the snow; LaForgue tries, unsuccessfully, to persuade Chomina to embrace Christ before he dies. When Chomina dies, he sees the She-Manitou appearing to him. Annuka and Daniel take LaForgue to the outskirts of the Huron settlement, but leave him to enter it alone, because Chomina had dreamed that this must happen. LaForgue finds all but one of the French inhabitants dead, murdered by the Hurons who blamed them for a smallpox epidemic. The leader of the last survivors tells LaForgue that the Hurons are dying, and he should offer to save them by baptizing them. LaForgue confronts the Hurons.

Even though Tigress and Mantis are annoyed at the deception, Po engages their interest in the story of the trio of masters first met. Long ago in the city of Jinzhao, Rhino , Ox  and Croc  are small-time pit fighters who attracted the attention of Grand Master Oogway , who, seeing their talent and focus, wished them to find something worthy to fight for. As the trio fought themselves to a standstill, two of the villainous Wu Sisters were freeing their leader and eldest sister Su Wu . To recapture them, Oogway persuades Rhino, Ox and Croc into helping him find the sisters at Hubei Volcano. However, to his disappointment, Oogway has to appeal to them with vague prospects of being put on a path to riches to get that cooperation. While the Wu Sisters plot to unite the various criminal gangs to seize control of China, Master Oogway has to brush off each of his compatriot's petty proposals during the journey to abandon the others for their benefit. At camp, Oogway eventually discovers that while Croc and Ox are motivated by narcissism and greed respectively, Rhino has a deep-seated need to win his dad Master Flying Rhino's  respect. To that, Oogway suggests to all of them that their current goals will only keep them wanting more, and changing their ways can lead to better lives for all. Before the trio can comprehend Oogway's point, a messenger bird from the Sisters arrives to reveal their plan and Oogway has the company set off immediately. To encourage them to change their ways, Master Oogway secretly leads the trio into an extremely dangerous path and forces them to cooperate in order for them all to safely pass to illustrate his point of selflessness. However, when the trio finally learn that Oogway was being metaphorical about his promise of riches, their protests accidentally get them trapped on a river of lava. Oogway manages to get them to safe ground, but he falls over a lava fall, leaving them with only the advice \"Remember the path\" to guide them now. Dispirited at their loss, the trio try to find their way home. However, they encounter a rabbit village devastated by the Wu Sisters and its citizens' desperately try to hire them for protection. Moved by the villagers' plight, the trio decline the fee and resolve to stop the Wu Sisters for the sake of a higher ideal. Thus motivated, the trio interrupt the Sister's summit. When the former street fighters reveal that they're doing this for purely honor, they intimidate the various visiting gangs into retreating while the Wu Sisters fight alone.

The film shows the story of a bereaved Queen Victoria  and her relationship with a Scottish servant, John Brown , and the subsequent uproar it provoked. Brown had been a trusted servant of Victoria's then deceased and beloved Prince Consort, Prince Albert; Victoria's chief servants thought Brown might help to ease an inconsolable Queen since the Prince Consort's death in 1861. In 1863, hoping to subtly coax the Queen toward resuming public life after years of seclusion, Mr. Brown is summoned to court. The plan succeeds a little too well for the servants' liking, especially Victoria's chief secretary Sir Henry Ponsonby (played by [[Geoffrey Palmer  and The Prince of Wales  as well as other members of the Royal family; the public, press and politicians soon come to resent Brown's perceived influence over the queen. Brown takes considerable liberties with court protocol, especially by addressing Her Majesty as \"woman\". He also quickly takes control over the Queen's daily activities, further aggravating the tensions between himself and the royal family and servants. The moniker \"Mrs. Brown\", used both at the time and in the film, implied an improper, and perhaps sexual, relationship. The film does not directly address the contemporary suspicions that the Queen and Brown had had a sexual relationship and perhaps had even secretly married (see the article on [[John Brown , though cartoons from the satirical magazine Punch are shown as being passed around in Parliament . As a result of Victoria's virtual recluse, especially at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, something initially encouraged by Brown, her popularity is failing and there is a growing rise in republican sentiment. Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli  has a weakening hold over the House of Commons and a fear of rising anti-monarchical sentiment in the country. He persuades Brown to use his influence with the Queen and persuade her to return to the performance of her public duties, especially the speech from the throne at the impending opening of Parliament. Brown is reluctant to do so, rightly fearing that Victoria will take this as a personal betrayal. When Brown urges Victoria to return to London and fulfill her public duties, an argument ensues. Feeling betrayed by Brown, the Queen becomes enraged. She can't believe what she is hearing. When Brown once again refers to her as \"woman\", she sharply rebukes him. Leaving the room, she turns to Ponsonby and Jenner requesting that they serve her needs, clearly reducing Mr. Brown's contact and influence over her. Their relationship was never to be the same again. The Queen's eventual acquiescence and her decision to return to public life eventually leads to a revitalization of her popularity and a resurgence in public support of the monarchy. Brown continues to serve Queen Victoria, until his death in 1883. In his final years, his duties become reduced to head of security. The palace staff has become weary of Brown's dogmatic ways and they mock and rebuke his security efforts as paranoid delusions. Finally, during a public event, a gun wielding assassin appears out of the crowd leaping toward the royal family. An ever vigilant Mr. Brown successfully thwarts the assassination attempt. At dinner the next evening, the Prince of Wales retells the story, bragging to their dinner companions that he had been the one to warn Brown of the assassin. Seeing through her son's bragging, the Queen announces instead that a special medal for bravery, the \"Devoted Service Medal,\" will be minted and awarded to Mr. Brown. Some years later, Mr. Brown becomes gravely ill with pneumonia after chasing through the woods late at night searching for a possible intruder. Hearing of Brown's illness, the Queen visits Mr. Brown's room and is visibly shaken to see her old friend so ill. Placing a cool damp cloth against Brown's fevered brow, she confesses that she has not been as good a friend as she might have been in recent years. It is clear that her apology is accepted by Brown. The pneumonia proves fatal for Brown and he passes away. During his years of service, Mr. Brown has kept a diary and upon his passing, Ponsonby and Dr. Jenner discuss its contents stating that it must never be seen by anyone. Holding the diary at his side, Ponsonby walks away and it's implied that the diary will be destroyed or will disappear. Dr. Jenner also reveals that the Prince of Wales has hurled the Queen's favorite bust of Mr. Brown up and over the \"palace wall\", referring us back to the film's opening sequence.

Lieutenant Alexis Rosanoff  of the Imperial Russian Air Force lands in Paris after a dangerous flight over enemy territory, bringing important dispatches from Russia. He persuades his superior, General Serge Shubin , to take him to see Mata Hari perform that night. Rosanoff is instantly smitten by her . By youthful exuberance and good looks, he persuades her to spend the night with him. However, the next morning, she makes it clear to him that it was a one-time dalliance. Carlotta  secretly instructs Mata Hari to report to Andriani , their spymaster. Andriani orders her to find out from General Shubin the contents of the dispatches Rosanoff brought.

Rosanoff arrives unexpectedly, in case Shubin has further instructions before the pilot returns to Russia with more important dispatches.

Furious, Shubin telephones Dubois and confirms that Mata Hari is a spy. She shoots him dead before he can carry through on his threat to implicate Rosanoff. Mata Hari goes into hiding, but when Andriani informs her that Rosanoff crashed and was seriously injured on his way back to Russia, she defies him and resigns to go to her love.

Pete is angered when Donald steals food right from under his nose, and lights a stick of dynamite, which Donald takes, thinking it a sausage. After the explosion, Pete  drags Donald into the woods and tells him that he will have to work for him as a lumberjack for food. Donald is rather incompetent at logging activities, causing a heavy branch to fall on Pete, and running a saw through Pete's clothing. The last straw comes when he chops down a tree that lands on Pete. Pete roars like a lion with anger. Pete furiously starts chasing Donald to some nearby railroad tracks, where they both jump on handcars and begin a lengthy chase. Pete tries to stab Donald with a harpoon-like spear, but only manages to dismantle Donald's handcar piece by piece. Eventually Donald is only running along the tracks, but he manages to largely destroy Pete's by dumping a load of coal from an overhead chute down on his. Pete is then left just riding one wheel on his car like a unicycle. Donald then comes to a railroad switch and pulls it, causing Pete to crash into a row of boxcars.

When he wins a lot of money cheating at craps, he has to be rescued from a robbery attempt by a complete stranger, Ballin Mundson . Mundson tells him about an illegal high-class casino, but warns him not to practice his skills there. Farrell ignores his advice, cheats at blackjack, and is taken by two men to see the casino's owner, who turns out to be Mundson. Farrell talks Mundson into hiring him and quickly gains his confidence. However, the unimpressed washroom attendant, Uncle Pio , keeps calling him \"peasant\". One day, Mundson returns from a trip with a beautiful and spirited new wife, Gilda . It is immediately apparent that Johnny and Gilda have a history together, though both deny it when Mundson questions them. Johnny visits Gilda alone in the bedroom she shares with her husband, and the two have an explosive confrontation that elucidates both their past romantic relationship, which ended badly, and their love-hate dynamic. While it is unclear just how much Mundson knows of Gilda and Johnny's past relationship, he appears to be in ignorance when he assigns Farrell to keep an eye on Gilda. Johnny and Gilda are both consumed with their hatred of each other, as Gilda cavorts with men at all hours in increasingly more blatant efforts to enrage Johnny, and he grows more abusive and spiteful in his treatment of her. Meanwhile, Mundson is visited by two German businessmen. Their secret organization had financed a tungsten cartel, with everything put in Mundson's name to hide their connection to it. However, when they decide it is safe to take over, Mundson refuses to transfer ownership to his backers. The Argentine secret police are interested in the Germans; government agent Obregon  introduces himself to Farrell to try to obtain information, but the American knows nothing about that aspect of Mundson's operations. When the Germans return later, Mundson shoots and kills one of them. That same night, at Mundson's house, Farrell and Gilda have another hostile confrontation, which begins with them angrily declaring their hate for each other, and ends with them passionately kissing. Mundson arrives at that moment, then flees to a waiting airplane. Farrell and Obregon witness its short flight; the plane explodes shortly after takeoff and plummets into the ocean. However, Mundson has parachuted to safety, thus faking his death. With Mundson apparently dead, Gilda inherits his estate. Gilda and Johnny marry, but while Gilda married him for love, Johnny has married her to punish them both for their mutual betrayal of Mundson. He stays away, but has her guarded day and night out of contempt for her and loyalty to Mundson. Gilda tries to escape the tortured marriage a number of times , but Johnny is ultimately able to thwart every attempt, determined to keep her trapped in the relationship that has become a prison for them both. Finally, Obregon tells Farrell that Gilda was never truly unfaithful to Mundson or to him, prompting Farrell to try to reconcile with her. At that moment, Mundson reappears, armed with a gun. He faked his death to deceive the Nazis. Mundson tells them he will have to kill them both, but Uncle Pio manages to fatally stab him in the back. Obregon shows up, and Johnny tries to take the blame for the murder. Uncle Pio finally credits Johnny for being a true gentleman, while insisting that he had killed Mundson. Obregon reminds them both that Mundson had technically died years before, but there is also such a thing as justifiable homicide. Farrell gives Obregon the incriminating documents from Mundson's safe, and the police confiscate the estate for the government. Farrell and Gilda finally reconcile and confess their mutual love, and apologize for the many emotional wounds they have inflicted on each another.\n","\n","    ### Response:  Gilda\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.

After she sings the first verse of \"Five O'Clock Whistle\" in the opening to establish this fact, Bugs pops out of her basket to ask where she's going. She replies that she's going to \"bring a little bunny rabbit to my grandma's. Ta HAVE, see?\" With this part of the story set up, the wolf is now introduced. The wolf switches a \"Shortcut to Grandma's\" sign, so that Red has to go through a long mountain path, while the wolf uses the real shortcut ‚Äì a few short steps to the house. Seeing a note on the door that Grandma isn't home , the wolf sneaks inside and dresses like grandma ‚Äì only to find that a bunch of other wolves are similarly dressed and waiting in the bed for Red! The wolf  growls for the others to \"COME ON! COME ON! take a powder ‚Äì this is MY racket!\" and the other wolves leave muttering to themselves, and a small wolf leaves from under the pillow. Once in bed, the wolf waits for Red to come to the door. But in a twist the wolf isn't interested in eating Red, but rather the rabbit she brought with her. The wolf quickly shuffles Red out the door and tries looking for Bugs. Bugs, however, gets the better of the wolf and runs around the house, being 'chased' by the wolf. Along the way, Bugs subjects the wolf to the famous lots-of-doors in-and-out routine . The wolf, however, is constantly interrupted by Red, who continues asking the questions from the story, such as \"That's an awfully big nose for you ‚Äì ta HAVE.\" Towards the end of the cartoon,the wolf finally corners bugs but Bugs imitates the wolf's every action even when the wolf keeps telling Bugs to stop. After eluding the wolf by distracting him into singing, \"Put On Your Old Gray Bonnet \", Bugs manages to get a glowing coal from the fireplace and sends the wolf to the ceiling by scorching his backside. When the wolf comes down, Bugs has a large shovelful of coals waiting to scorch the wolf. However, the wolf manages to catch his feet on the ends of two benches just in time, doing the \"splits\", facing the camera. Instead of simply kicking one of the benches away, Bugs proceeds to dump heavy weights into the wolf's arms. After clearing out just about everything in the house , Bugs is about to apply the coup de grace on the wolf ‚Äì by placing an olive branch on top of the mass of junk and furniture the wolf is holding ‚Äì when Red comes back in, bellowing \"Hey, GRANDMA!\"  By this time, even Bugs has had enough of Red's interruptions, prompting him to say, \"I'll do it, but I'll probably hate myself in the morning.\" He descends the ladder, out of frame, there's a shuffling of the furniture... and now RED is the one desperately trying to avoid getting scorched , while Bugs and the wolf, arms around each other's shoulders, share a carrot and self-satisfied looks, and await the inevitable.\n","\n","    ### Response:  A Very Merry Christmas\n","\n","Based on the given instruction and context, generate an appropriate response\n","\n","    ### Instruction:\n","    Look at the described movie plots and details and identify the movie name or names which best matches the plot description.
