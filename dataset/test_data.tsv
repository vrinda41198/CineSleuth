The film is about young, naive, maybe little stupid girl, that lives only with her mother or grandmother, she is obssesed with everything around films, when she has to find a proper work, her mother/grandmother helps her and finds some film industry audition, but when she arrives at the place, she finds out there are only women that want that "job", quickly she finds that its about porn industry. she leaves the place and decides that she will travel into italy to learn more about life.	In Search of Fellini
There was a lady who rents out her guest house to a single, charming man who keeps to himself but turns out to be a serial killer. He had some kind of briefcase/kill kit (dark brown leather if I remember correctly). He seemed to be very meticulous. There were women who were murdered (think modern day Jack the Ripper vibes) and I think a male detective was snooping around. The movie comes to an end when the lady who owns the property starts connecting the dots. She goes out to the guest house only to find the man is gone.	The Lodger
In the ending, where the setting is like prom. The antagonist got prom queen and she’s on stage about to accept when the protagonist (or maybe her friends) tap into the intercom. Through it, they play a recording on repeat: “I killed them. I killed the teachers. Deal with it.” This results in everyone’s mood dropping straight down to “you fucking dirtbag” as she sheepishly walks through the crowd	Jawbreaker
In this movie there is some sort of predicament where these two guys are stuck somewhere and there is a sort of tub where one of them can lay in and live life back home. The one guy has a wife at home and loves going back to see them, and the other guy gets jealous. He ends up stealing the other guys access to his life and essentially lives in his body, sometimes without he wife even knowing. 	Black Mirror - Beyond the Sea
As per the title, a movie I from late night on a premium channel I saw as a youngster in the 90's, Male lead who is playing an actor who reenacts crimes for tv that gets set up as the real criminal or is the actual criminal. I remember this 90's low budget R movie, I think the main character falls for his (very blond) co star in the crime reenactments that are made for TV. I think at the end she sets him up to be the actual criminal who is known to break into women house's and hides in the closet waiting to attacks them. It was a late night movie on HBO (or maybe Showtime/Cinemax) so it had Nudity but not excessive, so its most likely an erotic thriller and I do remember it having a sex scene in a (blue?) public bathroom stall at some point. Feel like it might have been a rip off of basic instinct, would have been early 90's though, maybe like 93ish (but maybe earlier too). Description of the main actors (to the best of my memory). Male Lead: darks hair, olive skin tone in my memory, but he doesn't pop out to me as someone I would know from other films. Female Lead: I thought the woman might have been Shannon Tweed, but I could not find it under her films, as she did similar types of movies (though I think the women in this was almost platinum blond if memory serves)	In The Heat Of Passion
2010s Netflix horror movie where couple moves to this ranch house where woman starts to go crazy and sees/ hears crazy things (I can’t remember-she may be pregnant too) but it’s slowly revealed that her future self is doing these things to her current self and then she figures out what’s going on. It’s a psychological horror where you think something demonic is happening but it’s just a rip in time to when something bad happened to her	Visions starring Isla Fisher
it was conncted to some kind of blue lightnng, a man going back in time or in the future in an alien like futuristic jungle	The Time Machine
The female lead froze sperm of someone she got from someone else to get back at a man then used it on herself and says its his he looks surprised and she says "Ask me how I did it"	Gone Girl
the plot was about this lady who was in space on a ship or shuttle and she eventually finds another shuttle drifting and rescues a dude from it. unbeknownst to her, this guy had this egg shaped alien artifact that sort of gave him strength and made him younger and theres even a scene where he ends up getting his arm cut off but manages to stick it back and heal because of that artifact. later in the movie it turns out that the egg artifact was a sort of alien booby trap left by some race, and the way it worked was it got you addicted by making you strong and young and stuff and you'd want to take it back to your home planet, leading to it exploding and destroying the planet. the female character learns this and tries to stop him i think.	Supernova
there is a son and mother both are black actors and the son get killed and the mother ends up hallucinating a best friend and she goes after every person that was involved in her sons murder the police get involved realize it's her but the group that she goes to for people who lost their children defend her	 Lila & Eve
One brother is a lot younger that the other and comes home high, the other questions him and then he gets mad, the little brother pushes the older one and then the older one chases after him. It all comes to a scene in the kitchen (the camera looks towards to rooms one on the left and one on the right) the older brother catches up to the younger one and hits him and then stars crying/screaming while staying with his back on a fridge on the ground while his little brother runs away.  	Mid 90s
It's a movie about a British serial killer. I don't know names or who played it. All I know it was kinda long, had multiple scenes of the killer eating sausages at this restaurant very grossly. The ending he got caught due to the police finding the vehicle he stole at the restaurant he was eating a sausage at and there was a body in the trunk. Oh also the killer narriated the entire movie in a very monotone voice.	Angst
a 2000s movie, I remember it was about this girl that lived in the forest I think with her father? (Maybe alone) She had all these things set up, including a zip line. It was on an island, I remember her being upset about the island becoming popular with tourists. I think it also might’ve been about the ocean, or finding/saving one of her parents? I also remember there was a scene where she was in the ocean with someone, it was night and they were sinking while she tried to reach for them. Sorry about the vagueness.	Nim's Island
Bunch of guys try to fool some drug dealers with fake money/not enough money.    They go to the drug dealer's house and go up a long set of straight stairs to the 2nd floor.   Once they are inside, the dealer locks a metal door behind they with a key.    Eventually a fight breaks up, guns are fired.	Boogie Nights
A woman in what seemed to be a red puffer jacket was looking/running through an old cottage style house. Then she was running through a field/mountains. She seemed to be worried and/or running from something, but I never got to see. This was all in a surreal slow-motion, while the film panned to different odd imagery as I'll list below. The scenes would cut to another random woman just standing on this same house, then I think she fell? And had a massive wound on her stomach. There was a group of 3-4 priests doing some sort of chant in a church, it seemed to be unrelated to what the other scenes were displaying.There was a constant creepy ambient white noise in the background for most of this.  	Enys Men
I am looking for an short animated cartoon from 40's or 50s. I remember that it is short animated movie about dogs and a fox. The fox was chased by pack of dogs, but he was clever and hid himself in the tree. I remember that fox is lying on his back - lounging on a branch of this tree. 	By Leaps and Hounds
theres this really goofy/dumb/funny looking movie that popped up a couple times on my feed. All I can say is the main character is very flamboyant sounding and has this ridiculous bleach white long haircut with bangs. His helpers have gigantic white sphere helmets. all of the space people are wearing white suits... It Seems like the movie was made in the last few years, but tried to look like old 70s technicolor. One of the videos was the main guy finding some "fungus" that I'm pretty sure was a cow patty, he smells it and then flies/levitates.	Gentlemen Broncos
Basically story goes there is this husband and wife and they seem very happy together, then it turns out his wife betrays him she has a boyfriend and she sets him up to be killed. Her boyfriend kills him (Don't remember how) they are happy that he died, I think the husband had alot of money. It turns out that he didn't actually die he was still alive and decided to pretend to be dead and haunt them for revenge. He had a funeral and a grave too. There's a cop investigating his "murder" and he stands by his grave investigating his suspicions. I believe its an 80s or 90s movie.	Buried Alive   
I saw part of a movie 20+ years ago that I was never able to complete or find again. An early scene included children/teens running as fast as they could outside (on a trail?). Slow runners were gunned down. I want to say an organization was looking for or training elite soldiers from birth/young ages. But I never saw the whole thing and only remember this one scene.	Soldier
In this movie there's a convict on the run or something like that, he comes across a kid who I think is a rich kid and kidnaps him. As time passes, him and the kid develop a bond and then at the end of the movie he drops the kid of back to his home. The convict gives the kid glasses or a hat to remember him by. The last shot of the movie is the kid putting the glasses or hat on a statue or something like that then runs off back to the thief, going missing again.	A Perfect World
A family moved to an old house which turned out to be haunted. I think the dad travelled for work so was away at times. Two kids, I believe both daughters. There was a tree with swing in back yard. I recall a few scenes: the figure haunting the house was in a cabinet in one of the bedrooms, and in another scene, the father fell through a shaft into the basement.	The Conjuring
A man rents a small apartment in a coastal fishing village. I think he is hiding out, or hiding his identity. I think he is a photographer. I think he did a small photography gallery of people in the local village. I think it's set in an old European fishing village. I think something happened or someone died, and he is hiding out. 	The Big Picture 2010
This movie has to be at least 10 years old, though I suspect it might even be a 90s or 00s movie. The plot (from what I remember) is a man, his wife and his two children (I think?) move into an old house. Think Victorian mansion. The family are all African American, or at least darker-skinned. The house turns out to be haunted by the previous owner, who was a wealthy man/noble. Coincidentally, the wife of the man looks like the long lost love of the ghost, her dispappearence/death being the reason that he couldn't move onto the afterlife. At the end, it turns out that the butler/servant of the ghost man killed his love because he didn't think she was suitable for his master. The wife dances with the ghost which helps him move on and he embraces his real love as he ascends to the afterlife. 	The Haunted Mansion
Having trouble remembering a 2010s horror movie. From what I remember: The movie is about a single white male who's mother recently died. Him and his mom were estranged leading up to her death. However in her will she left the house to him. In one scene the son listens to a meditation recording while on the couch. Another scene is him collapsing on the door leading to the entrance of the house and closing his eyes as the monster is chasing him. The monster if I can remember is some sort of quadruped creature.	Boogeyman
Stumbled upon this movie. It was black and white and it was directed either by bunuel or jodorowsky , it was a kind of cineforum about surreal movies. I remember this scene where some characters are having an heavy discussion that ends up throwing things out of the window. It starts with a lamp, then pieces of forniture, at some point a person dressed in white resembling the pope also fall from the windows	L' Age D' Or
saw a movie within the last 15ish years about a boy who has to avenge his mother after she's killed by a gang of outlaws. Pretty sure the movie took place somewhere in Europe as some characters were subtitled. A very important plot point is that this boy is able to become a great killer because he managed to get his hands on a repeating rifle from America that has only recently been invented, and he catches the enemies off guard with his firepower.	The Dark Valley
I watched a movie about a year or two ago that was loosely based on the amityville horror, I swear Victoria pedretti was in it but I couldn’t find it on her imbd. It wasn’t entirely a horror movie but all I can really remember is that a couple move into this new house somewhere, the husband is a teacher I think and their house is haunted. Anyway eventually the husband cheats on her with some girl who rides horses and in the end the haunting causes the husband to murder the wife and then it ends on some painting of a guy on a boat floating to a cross. 	Things Heard & Seen
I saw this movie a couple years ago and just saw random parts, but no matter what I look up I cannot figure out what it is. It’s a medieval / renaissance style movie that takes place in a castle. The one scene I remember the most was the king walking into his daughter’s room, (the princess :-D,) and she is like, kissing/hooking up with a servant boy. The king freaks out and chases the boy throughout the castle, but he didn’t see the boy’s face so he doesn’t know exactly who it is. He chases him back to the servant quarters which are like, a bunch of cots in a row with a ton of other servants sleeping in them. The servant boy lays down in his cot and pretends to be asleep, and the king comes down and starts to lean down and listen to all the servant’s hearts while they’re sleeping to see who’s heart is beating the fastest from running to find out which boy was kissing his daughter. Maybe some sort of Shakespeare adaption or…? I’m not sure. It seemed like an 80’s or 90’s type beat.	The Little Hours
So I only know like 10 seconds of the film in the movie the protagonist walks into a store and the front of the store kids are shouting were kids like they are Pokémon. And when the.guy buys someone the shop keepers voice is so loud it breaks the mic and when the protage walks out the shop keep used a cgi hand to call someone. It’s more Chinese/ Asian	Kung Pow: Enter the Fist
I remember a few scenes. One being a few people walking through an underpass, you can just see the outline of them and their weapons The main character had a brother who.died of an OD, he has flashbacks to his dead brother. Another being after winning the fight, he goes back to his mum's house, outside of the house he gets shot. I might have watched this in like 2007/8 I really can't remember much.	Deuces Wild
Military-style group possibly featured in the movie and with the main character the movie has a female lead they are possibly trapped either underground, or in a bunker "weird, warpy effects" throughout that affect the group. possibly some sort of quarantine, or containment	 Annihilation
Main character unwittingly becomes wrapped up in spy/crime stuff. I remember a scene where two henchmen are playing the board game kerplunk to pass the time. Probably released in 80's or 90's	The Man Who Knew Too Little
a man who works for a charity who has a girlfriend goes to the countryside to stay with his rich friends for their birthday, on his way he comes across this strange homeless man who he runs away from but later finds at the friends party. he seems to be losing his identity or misremembering his past. in his dreams he has nightmares one where his friend dies and when he wakes up has supposedly gone home, the homeless man shares a room with the main character and wears his clothes etc later his girlfriend accompanies him while the main character tells her to be careful around the man but everyone else has no issues with him weird events continue and later when they end up leaving the main character and girlfriend talk about marriage when the girlfriend quotes something weird that the homeless man normally says then the film ends with the main character uncomfortable.	All My Friends Hate Me
All I remember of the film is events of a girl in a Sci-Fi room who is locked in the "station" with a leading "mother". She wants to go out and see the world but the "mother" forbade it. One day she wakes up with the "station" in ruins which gives her the opportunities to leave. She finds the world in a like that of a post apocalyptic world. I also remember an event in which she meets a man of those lands and is running away from a cave into the water which was dangerous as it has these leeches/worms that enter you. I think the girl rescues him and then quick cuts to him being on a cross and her screaming. Then he vomits the worms/leeches on her in which she wakes up and she is back in the Sci-Fi room and now she is ready to step out into the real world.	 MindWarp
I think this movie is from between 2005 and 2015. The two characters are initially fighting in ships but fall to the ground on a desert planet, survive and continue fighting. The alien has a helmet and body armor which I think were red. I don't remember much of the rest and it's probably mixed with bits from other films/serials. 	 Sounds like Hunter Prey
I am looking for a film but cant find it anywhere I saw it on Talking Pictures channel (UK) it is an old film pre-1970's but post 1940's, its a very British Movie, about a boy (8 yo) who is on a beach and sees another boy (5 yo) who has a cool marble he wants, he tricks the boy to swap it for an invisible compass. There is more to it, his feeling of guilt, paranoia the cops are after him etc. 	The Magnet
From what I can remember there’s this rich man in town who is very mysterious. No one really knows him. I can’t remember if he’s a beast all the time or if he turns into one at times. This female child manages to get in his home and befriend him. They have a secret friendship. One day the girl gets hurt and even though the beast guy is afraid of going into the public he doesn’t want her to die. He takes her into town but the townspeople assume he hurt her and I think kill him. The girl finds out and goes to his house to mourn him. A human version of the guy appears but isn’t the same guy. It’s almost to signify that he’s free and can move on.	 Rigoletto
All I remember about the plot is that it was the movie was mostly set in a university. There was a red head main female character who was in college. She had a boyfriend whom she thought was the killer on campus. There was a band who sang songs throughout the whole movie. It was a horror movie… it was either made in the 80s or very early 90s. The killer may have worn a mask ( I am unsure of this as I remember a mask being worn by another character thought to be the killer).	 Rush Week
Movie where girl is floating at end. (Not scary). I feel it happens at the end with a song. Maybe ending credits. I thought it was Matilda. Then maybe Adaams family.	 Beetlejuice
whats the movie where there's a lot of people on a cruise ship(?) and they're all dancing and they all get sliced in half by a freak accident involving a wire?	 Ghost ship
If I remember correctly, there was a scene in this comedy film where a janitor was mopping the floor in the main lobby of a hotel or some type of big building. Then one of the main characters runs to the washroom in this lobby shitting himself and makes a huge mess on the floor possibly by flooding the washroom and he gets shit all over the main lobby floor apologizing to the janitor. It's been years I've remembered the scene but can't remember the title!	I hope they serve Beer In hell
I am looking for American movie from 90s or 2000s (at least 20 years ago). Three men meets a father with his daughter and son at a gas station. The daughter shows them the middle finger, and they follow them home and decide to break in. The old man is some kind of rich man, the son is small. One of the burglars has long black hair. In general, I think they wanted to kidnap the guy's children, but they hid in the house. At the end, one of them sets the house on fire, because he was a pyromaniac.	Hostage
A classic horror movie set in a late medieval castle in a rainy island, my guess is it's made in 1980s or 1990s. I watched it while I was a very young kid from TV, don't remember the name of the movie though. The plot is that there's a guy between the people who is secretly murdering everyone in very disgusting ways, like splitting them in half or imprisoning them in those iron maiden cages, and everyone is terrified but there's storm going on so no one can flee for now, and even the sick murderer portray himself as terrified and actually not even the viewer knows who is doing all of this till the end. I was very scarred during the whole movie, TV was on and no one was paying attention otherwise they would have not let a 6 or 7 year old kid watch it alone. I can never forget the horror it was the most scary movie I ever watch till this day. Please if anyone knows it tell me, I would appreciate it pretty much.	The Name of the Rose
I'm looking for a post apocalyptic movie where almost the entire Earth is covered by water with just a few points of land still above water where, if I remember correctly, there were some cities. There might have been a plot point about the cities being controlled by the big bad EVIL elite, but that might be me just mixing up movies in my head. What I remember most clearly about the movie is that it ends with the heroes finding an ancient device in a chamber hidden inside a crack in a mountain that they then activate which sets off a series of explosions which open a giant fissure at the bottom of the ocean which starts to drain the oceans away.	Sounds like Lost City Raiders
Here's what I remember: a team of people get assigned the job of making a cross to go on top of a church. One of them has to climb a tall ladder to put up the cross. The main character, a young boy, has a vision that his older brother will die if he climbs the ladder, so the young boy chooses to do it instead. The older brother gives him a glove to wear while climbing, and the boy ends up falling to his death (his vision was of a person wearing his brother's glove, which turns out to have been the young boy	The Navigator: A Medieval Odyssey
From what i remember it’s a guy (or a guy and a girl) in a house and he gets tied up by a weird little puppet or something, the puppet then forces him to listen to a bunch of different really bad short horror stories. Each story they cut to it like it’s own mini movie. I’ve googled different horror anthologies for HOURS and can’t find it All i remember is it was really bad (not one of those so-bad-its-good like genuinely terrible), poor quality, guessing i’d say it came out in the 90s or early 2000s and I believe the title was a girls name? (think annabelle but obviously not that)	Charlotte
The plot is basically about these two teenage boys but one of them is very demented and cruel and kills people (…I think) One of the boys has diabetes and I remember that being important. I think the film ends or starts with a car crash? Where one of them dies? The film was def American and probably late 2000’s/early 2010’s. It has this sort of green filter over the entire film.  	Seconds Apart
I watched a horror movie when I was really young and only remember one scene. Some people were running and trying to hide from the monster. They ended up in a police station and one character locks themselves in the jail cell and backs up against the wall. Then the monster punches through the wall and pulls them through. 	The Beast Within
I think this movie came out in the early 2000s maybe late 90s. It’s two teen girls who walk around in their hometown and I think they had a creepy neighbor and one of the girls had a crush on him and I think this crush led to a friendship breakup but I’m not 100% sure. It wasn’t a scary movie and it kinda gave me “freaks and geeks” kinda vibes but I think it was set during summer time so no filming in a school. I think the creepy neighbor worked out in his garage with the door open.	 Ghost World
It is an animated film with the style of it being almost like paper cutouts. I almost wanna say in the style of Samurai Jack but not exactly. Slightly different. The theme of the characters and environment is Nordic/Vikings and the story is that there is this huge wall that is being constructed to keep the people safe, but it follows this young kid who continuously escapes out through the wall. Outside the wall, there is this girl or girl-like-entity (like a shapeshifter maybe?) and she has dazzling eyes. I think she was very pale skinned. The art was Incredibly beautiful in my memory from when I was a child. Beautiful green trees paired with the vibrant eyes of the girl and the boy being scared, but curious.	 The Secret of Kells
What I remember: a girl (teenager with long straight hair) enters a sort of house for mentally unstable people. We see a lot of her consultations with one of the psychiatrist (a middle aged man) that seems to be fascinated or at least intrigued with her. I don't really recall any specific scene of that movie but I think that by the end it's revealed that the girl has been manipulating a lot of the people in that house...	Mindscape
so i believe this an animated movie that's very very old. i think it's in english??? hopefully it is. it's a kids movie where a mom and son have a tough relationship and they somehow found themselves kidnapped by aliens in space. They managed to escape and were wearing space helmets, but the son tripped (mind you, they're still in space and on either mars, the moon, or some other unknown planet. i remember the planet looked red/orange and sandy). for some reason, gravity didn't stop the son's fall and his helmet cracked and he's quickly losing air. so, the mom took off her helmet and gave it to her son, basically sacrificing herself. i don't remember the ending, just that it was very sad and i don't even know if the mom lived or not.	Mars needs moms
The film is a children's 3D animation for the male audience, I remember that this spring looked like the "Larva" of Larva (a tv animation), but, I think the spring have a moustache, I can't remember this fact, and in this animation, there aren't humans, all character It is a object (i don't remember If everyone it's a object). This movie is old and the Red Spring isn't the main character  	The Magic Roundabout
basically Its a white guy and a Black guy on a quest to stop a terrorist group maybe? I only remember one scene where the black guy says that he is a very dangerous man and the white guy points at him and repeates it. I think they were trying to steal a truck. I also can remember how some old guy got killed and the white man was the last guy talking to him about something. And maybe there is a bomb in it? Or even a nuke. I thoiught it was national security but thats not it.	Chill Factor
It’s about a scientist who invents a machine to look into/record dreams. I can’t remember exactly, but I think the scientist’s son has to stop him from using his invention because there is a morality aspect regarding either the son’s wife or his mother (the scientist’s wife).	 The Discovery 
all I remember is that it had to be something fashion-based because the most I could ever remember about it is how it was apparently an inspiration for a MET Gala theme.I did remember some few parts about it, I believe it was about a 'reincarnating' character? The character has led a few lives and their gender in each lives doesn't necessarily alternate but it's never just one gender. In one life they're a boy, in another, they're a girl. The scene that I remember the most was that in one life they were a girl and they were wearing something around the Elizabethan era(?), I'm unsure of what specific era it was, but they picked up their skirts and started to run in some maze-like garden.Yeah, I know, practically no details to go off on but all I remember is that they were reincarnating and was either a boy or a girl in their lives	Orlando
It was an older movie, probably from the 1980s, centred around a girls school I believe, where the students took over the facility as a sign of protest. I think the film was based on true events, because the ending featured a real showing each of the characters and what became of them.	All I Wanna Do
What i remember is there was a group of 4 or 5 people (one of them was a fireman) exploring an asylum or hospital for some reason they were pick off one by one by various creatures within this hospital/asylum. The ending was the last surviving female whimpering camera in hand stumbling into some pigman humanoid creatures who kidnaps her we dont see her die as the camera was left on the floor and she was carried away off screen.	Quarantine
A psychological horror where a man is in a house and he is like an architect or something, he designs the scary house i think or something like that. And a woman wants to leave the house because she is frightened and is trying to escape the house but when she runs through the forest she again finds the house because of the man, like he architectured it infront of her eyes.	The Night House
It was about a man who was returning to the town where he had moved as a teenager (probably around 15-18 years old). The film was mainly about his memories (retrospection). I remember that there was a team of boys from his class, and the brother of their "leader" had autism (if I remember correctly). The scene that stuck in my mind the most was when this particular brother stepped into the path of an oncoming train at the railway station, and the "leader" of these boys (i.e. his brother) took it coldly. There was also a love story, and the main character's friend was also important. I don't remember much else... I watched it on TV a long time ago. 	A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints
At the end of the movie, after an unsuccessful investigation a male agent comes to the house of the mother of a victim, and end up looking around the shed that is at the back of her garden, only to find inside a man that was a suspect in the murder of her son/daughter years ago. The man is in a cage, in really poor shape, and is kept barely alive by the mother. The mother then arrives and confronts the agent, and then they agree to let the man out of his misery, and the agent shots and kills him ?	Secrets in Their Eyes
A while back I saw a youtube clip of a movie where a soldier restarts the day every time he dies. In the clip, he and a woman who's helping him go into a building under lockdown, using a path he knows from dying on it a bunch, to talk to a general and get him to open a safe. Then, on the way back out, the woman betrays him. The clip ended before they explain why, and the poster of the clip didn't give the movie title or time period. It looked relatively modern though. Anyone know which one it is?	Edge of Tomorrow
The details I remember was that this movie was something about a (traveling?) Magician. Who had a mirror or something along the lines, and made a deal with who I think was the devil? The deal I think was something about getting more souls than the other. I remeber one scene where in what I think was the world within the mirror there were three men who saw a large woman, called out that it was their mother. All three men ran to the large woman, went under their dress and then I believe died and there was a reveal that the woman was the devil in disguise and claimed the souls of those men. I think the disguise was some sort of mechanical suit? I also remember vary vague things like the main cast being I think the Magician who was a man, a woman who I belive was an assistant and another man who I can't remember his role. I also think the Magician tried to hang themself at some point in the movie.	The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus
Racing movie about a driver engineer mechanic who tells owner of racing team he’ll pay the owner to be their engineer, gets lap time down minus 10, 15 or 20 seconds then tell the owner he wants to be paid.	Rush
All I remember is a bunch of people packed in a crowded building in the winter. I'm guessing they were very poor, I don't remember the nationality. One person was infested with bugs and someone helped by removing some of their clothing and covering all but a small piece of it outside in the snow. All the bugs moved to the very tip and were taken care of.	 The Way Back
I need the name of the movie that follows a woman which I don’t remember the name, at one moment in suspicious circumstances people she knows in some way start to die, some of them she didn’t see or hear in sometime so she just hears I think from a friend that they died and also how they died, at one moment she realizes that they were all jurors or somehow connected together with her that participated in accusing a person of death, this is the second part of the movie, I think that friend of hers also died, and as far as I remember she found out that person they accused was innocent and his spirit now somehow wants a revenge, and he kills everyone except the girl that is main role.. The movie is horror/thriller	Summoned
The movie was about a man who could see ghosts. They help him catch the killer? Stop him from getting killed? I remember that a lot of the killer/protagonist action happened either at an asylum or an abandoned mansion. There was a scene with the protagonist in a graveyard, and I think all the ghosts were green.	The Frighteners
I've been looking for a particular horror movie I saw around 2018-2020. It was about an organization that tortured humans with their worst fears to drive them insane, and they turned into some kind of creature after reaching their breaking point. There's a scene where the main character, a woman, is strapped to a table where a tube is placed above her face. After a few minutes, a tarantula starts crawling down the tube onto her face. I remember the ending of the movie was the main character escaping the facility, but the plot twist at the end was that she had become one of the creatures mentioned previously. 	Rupture
The movie starts on a train and that is where the characters are introduced they work at an electronic shop i think. in their youth crappy apartment. at the end of the movie the man and girl see each other again in the park at night and talk. I think it's snowing in that scene The movie i think is around 10 years old. i don't recall how long ago it was.	Us and Them
This movie starts out with a testing being done in the desert of a device that can pass through solid materials. The device is put in a car that is then aimed and raced towards a mountain side. At the last second the car disappears only to reappear on the opposite side of the mountain seconds later. Teh group goes to investigate it and notices some green slime on it. Later on they find out they have actually discovered a way to a different dimension and have been accidentally killing aliens each time they race through it.  	Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai
so it was clearly an old movie like i’d say 70s-80s but it was in color. it looked to be about a bunch of knights and crusaders in what appeared to be a rainforest or the amazon and they were fighting with the natives and setting fire to the forest in one scene. also in one scene they were on a raft down the river and also showed some clips of dead knights or people in armor dead. i think the era for the movie was like medieval? i’m honestly not sure	Aguirre, the Wrath of God
Trying to find a movie I watched a while ago about like California starting to get a lot of earthquakes and explode? I remember a family like trying to get away and eventually they fly a plane out I think? There was also like this homeless dude they met in the woods or something and he thought the world ending was like a message from god and he ends up dying due to an explosion or something.	2012

Trying to remember a movie from the 80s. Two people talking while someone is in the background doing burnouts. Think it was a comedy movie. Not sure. Two people are standing outside trying to have a serious conversation and the brother or friend of the person talking at the time is driving up and down the street doing burnouts.	Home for the Holidays
The plot begins when the husband and wife first started dating in the city, and then they move out to a house out in the countryside and start a family. For some reason I can't recall, the past is very slightly changed resulting in the precise moment when their first child was conceived changing, so that ultimately their kids are different. He's trying to get to a timeline to reunite his family. I fuzzily recall that he goes into an even worse timeline where his wife died although his original kid(s) are back, before the eventual happy ending. To be frank, it had a made-for-tv feel, almost like a Lifetime movie. Feels fairly recent nonetheless (at least, released after 2010-ish). Also the setting was possibly British (or northeastern US?) and the vibe was peculiarly conservative in its portrayal of dating and marriage. Very likely I saw it on Netflix but unfortunately that particular account no longer exists.	 About Time
the film involved a young man who was an amateur inventor, all his inventions were home made, similar to Doc Brown's breakfast machine at the beginning of Back to the Future and part of the movie involved a scheme where he forges money using a photocopier. I seem to remember that one of his inventions allowed his car to be steered from the passeenger seat and the VHS box art was a charactured watercolour similar to the Police Academy series. For some reason I feel that the movie was British and a low budget comedy	Malcolm
it was low budget and seemed like an amateur film, it was a middle aged man who got superpowers from some incident and i think he was estranged from his daughter and tried to find her, and there were some people trying to hunt him down, and at the end of the movie he destroyed the planet with these powers he couldnt control, the power had something to do with bright purple plasma and his body turned to a CGI man made of this plasma	Higher Power

This movie has great CGI effects , medium budget.	August Eighth
I'm looking for a movie which most of the story takes place on a lonely country road. It takes places in modern times. The main character is a gangster. He might be on the run. He's trying to set an ambush against a policeman. That's the main plot. I think the movie was released between 2007 and 2015 or something. 	Cop Car
Watched this in the 90s on a videotap. Remember a young woman driving to a mansion in the beginning to work as a governess (maybe?). She soon finds all mirrors in the household are covered by cloth but could not get any explanation for this. Then she stumbles into a room and finds a child facing the wall, in distress. She approaches the child, who turned around and showed his face seriously and horribly disfigured, not sure if it's a birth defect or later mutation. Anyway the child squieks and pursues the woman, trying to kill her, which indicates the child perhaps was a non-human after all.	Phenomena
So there is one part of a movie that I saw sometime in the early 2000s, but I believe the movie itself was made probably in the 80s or 90s from the quality of the video from what I remember. The only part I saw of this movie was that there were two little boys and a woman. I think the boys were brothers and one was a few years older than the other. The younger one was probably 4 or 5 maybe. The boys tied up the woman to a chair. I don't believe this woman was their mom, but maybe it could be a gf of their dad or maybe their stepmom? That detail I'm not sure about, but the way they were treating her made it seem that way. The older boy was being mean to the woman but the younger boy was trying to get the woman a glass of water or something. On the way over to the woman, the youngest boy falls down and lands on the drinking glass, breaking it into pieces. The pieces of glass go into the boys chest or abdomen. The woman then starts begging the older boy to let her go so that she could take his brother to the hospital. I don't know the resolution since that was the only scene I watched, but this part is just ingrained in my mind ever since. I have no idea what the movie is called, who the actors are, or what the movie was mainly about. Any ideas?	Mother's Boys
I'm searching for a movie I saw a couple of years ago about an alien invasion, pretty much like any other one. What I remember is that one guy was "killed" and was taken to the mothership where he would be turned into an alien or his body/mind would serve kind of as a vessel I think, but he somehow managed to take control of the alien and his eyes were blue, while the rest of the aliens had red eyes. I think it had a sequel and at the end, they would take over the spaceship and set off to explore the space or something like that but I'm not sure	Skyline
Hi, I'm looking for a movie that starts with a pregnant woman coming to her family home to meet with her father. After they spend some time together, she leaves and when she goes outside she gets shot on the doorstep. The killer drove off and after that, we see an investigation going on as to who killed her. Pretty sure they were people of color (maybe Native American or Mexican?) and I think the father was a cop. I saw this scene on TV over 10 years ago so I'm guessing it's from the 90s or early 00s 	Edge of Darkness
I remember seeing this movie a few years ago, it's a recent movie, where either humans or vampires suck the spirit from certain children to prolong their lives. The main character was a black girl or family and these people are hunting her to extract her energy to love longer. It's driving me crazy as I have a memory of this movie but cannot figure out what it was	 Dr Sleep
Hollywood movie which I saw on tv in maybe late 2010s where 2 complete strangers are having a really bad day and they meet each other briefly in some car accident and one of them elopes from the scene. This encounter results in one of them maybe missing his job interview and the other gets late to take custody of his child??. Anyways, it results in them starting the hunt down for the other (revenge or some bigger reason).These bits are only from some part of the movie that I watched and there could be more.	Changing lanes
I saw a movie not that long ago - it’s definitely an action/ thriller. I can’t remember what happened throughout the movie but i remember its like a guy running from people, or like a guy being chased and then the final scene the guy falls through a glass roof while being chased and suddenly he has a soft landing on a pad and either his brother or friend is like surprise! this was all a set up. everyone is an actor. none of it was real. and he was at a party or something.	The Game
There's a movie I watched a while ago, I don't remember the name. It's an old colour movie, I think it's from the 50s or 60s. I don't remember much, here's everything I remember: There's a woman who claims she's receiving harassing phone calls from an anonymous man. She and her husband contact the police, who tries to trace them. At one point, when the woman says the man is on the phone, the husband tells her to keep him on the line so he can talk to him, I think so the police can trace it. But by the time he gets there, she hangs up, she says she was too scared to keep talking to him. The police officer investigating it talks to the husband, and implies that he suspects the woman is faking it. The husband is talking to a friend about it, and says he didn't like the police officer's implication, but then says he supposes it's his job to look at it from all angles. Later, the woman says the man is calling her, and everyone including the husband thinks she's hallucinating it, I think it's because the phone was disconnected or something like that, and she's sent to a psychiatric hospital. Then it turns out the husband was somehow behind it all, and he was planning to kill her, but I don't remember any other details. I think there's also a subplot, but I don't remember it. It may be a British movie, I'm pretty sure at least the husband was British. Do you know what the name of the movie is?	Midnight Lace
It's about a family of three: mom, dad and son. But the son became paralytic and the parents were forced to look after him. Throughout the movie they all struggle to the new lifestyle of the boy. I think the movie was shot in the 70's, because the parents wear formal clothes in public places. I only remember two scenes. Just after the parents received the bad news, they walked outside the doctor's office through a hallway. They were walking slowly towards the camera, and the camera was walking backwards. The wife was holding his husband's arm tightly, as if she was feeling that she was gonna faint. Again, formal clothes. I guess this is towards the end of the film. The mom decided to read a book for his son while he was paralytic in bed, not being able to move any single muscle. She started reading and reading but he remained motionless. But then, I don't remember if he blinked or moved his chin, the point is that the kid responded to his mom reading the book. That gave her hope that his son is still aware, so she continued to read. And that's it, hope someone identifies the movie.	Lorenzo's oil
The basis of the movie involved people who would hallucinate into thinking an object was that of another person, but instead turned out to be something that would kill them. One scene I remember involved a guy thinking a shop fan was a hot chick and he moved in to “kiss her” and the blades sliced him to death. Another was where a guy thought he was being seduced by a woman, but turned out to be a zombie of some sort. It sounds like a triple F porno from the 80s, but it was a legit horror movie that was in steady rotation on channels like HBO. If I had to guess, it was out around the time of Phantasm. So I’m guessing mid-late 80s for the year this movie could have been made.	Leprechaun 2
This movie is about a girl and her mom struggling to make ends meet so she has to sell chicken eggs. The dad sends money through the mail and isn't seen throughout most of the movie. It might involve some journalism. Someone steals money from the safe that the mom hides in the house. Maybe she's is renting rooms to other people. The only evidence of who done it is a shoe print with a star engraved in the print. Might involve hobos at some point. One character might have a pet monkey or bird. Maybe he was the culprit and supposed to be like a magician type guy.	Kit Kittredge: An American Girl
From what I can remember, it’s an animated movie about a teenager who’s resistant to fire and have a few dragon like scales on him (he might also be able to spew fire). If my memory is right I also think this lead to him being bullied in school. When he so got tired of being bullied he did something that then later got him into trouble. Later in the movie I think it’s revealed that he’s the son of a monster much like Godzilla, but it could also be a dragon or something. I think this monster was the king of monsters. I remember he visited something that looked much like the underworld where he then had to prove his strength to everyone.	Firebreather
So a few years ago I watched a movie that the setting was maybe the 70s or so, I'm just guessing but it wasn't current time. They were college students I believe going on a trip to research. There had been a group already sent there along with a professor that disappeared. There was a factory that was abandoned. Turns out that the spores or something from the plants was killing people. They had to wear hazmat suits and the plants could sense their movements.	Flora
This is a lower-budget film probably made in the late 2010s but no later than 2022. The title may have started with "Return of the". Several siblings return to their childhood house possibly after their mother died. In the home they allegedly had encounters with a ghost when they were children. This was made into a movie and for years they were well-known. A cult of people obsessed with the ghost film break into the house and hold the family hostage in different rooms. At one point one of the "cultists" is wearing something like a black ghillie suit.	Return of the Whooper
Every single thing in this movie is a caricature, there are scenes of a fantasy city. As far as I remember there is no main character in this cartoon film but many different scenes, no dialogues, very intriguing sounds and a painted/pencil art style. I remember very well a scene with extremely tall boats and ships moving around a huge port. As far as I remember the cartoon style was to make everything super tall.	 The Triplets of Belleville
Rough Synopsis: So the movie is a horror/ thriller. It is about this halloween festival/ carnival where a woman goes and she gets drunk and starts "heckling" one of the acts where a woman who is on a safety harness gets fake hung and she points it out. I don't really remember what happens in the mid section of the film but the climax has her partner/ friend unalived in a barn I think. She is taken by the men as part of the act she heckled at the start and hung in front of the crowd who think its real which this time it actually is. Thats where the movie ends. Other details I remember: One of the covers for the movie had a guy in a weird babyish mask with a floral marking on it (I think). I think the main woman's partner was ex-armyAny help finding this obscure film please let me know, cheers	Hurt
Does anyone know here a movie from what I remember set in Japan, kinda set in a war zone (maybe WW2) or not, where there’s a scene where a guy does CPR to this Japanese person (who’s dead by that point) and he just continues doing it until blood comes out of the person’s nose?	Empire of the Sun
A color film from the 70s/80s in which a woman and her lover kill her husband and then have a car accident. The lover loses his memory and needs plastic surgery because he has become unrecognizable. The wife has his face reconstructed to resemble her husband, whose identity the lover takes. In the end, he discovers the husband's corpse on a boat, after several flashbacks that makes him remember where they had hidden the body.	Shattered
A few years back I watched a movie that centered around a girl who becomes stuck in an apartment/condo with friends, I believe two guys and another other girl, that they went to for a trip/vacation. They become trapped in the apartment (which I feel like overlooked the sea/ocean - it was on a higher up floor), can't reach anyone, cant see anyone else, run low on food, water, start to lose their minds, and it starts to become clear in the third act that this seems to be something supernatural, towards the end the others have either gone mad or died (I think) and the central girl starts seeing things, an older lady/ghost-like visions, it takes on a vaguely Shining-like vibe. I could have sworn it was an Irish or Scottish film, maybe British - can't really remember. 	The Snare

Any help appreciated! I remember watching this movie from the stairs when my parents thought I was asleep.    Pretty sure it’s a horror movie. A group of people, not sure if they are connected or not, are trapped in a mansion/museum and are trying to get out? I also think there are cameras tracking their every move? They are exploring the mansion but a rich young dumb blonde lady lags behind because she is trying to film everything on her camcorder and ends up getting tortured and dying by a spirit or ghost I think? Idk it’s such a vague memory in my mind that I can’t come up with any other memorable information.    Thank you!	House on Haunted Hill
A girl (I think?) is driving at the end of the movie at nighttime and theres a pumpkin in the backseat, and an alien pops out of it.

Thank you!	Spaced Invaders and Signs
I remember a film where a family is living in the shadow of an industrial plant and has toxic waste coming up in their sinks. They decide to move out into the countryside and live in a cabin.    They meet the local business owners and a family of survivalists who live in a bunker inside a fenced compound.    Everything is harder than expected, especially when a storm causes all the locals to flee for their cabin, including the survivalists whose bunker floods. The cabin breaks loose of its moorings and slides down a hill.    The film ends with the family trading in their cabin for a motorhome and deciding to live on the move.    I'm fairly sure the film wasn't "Adventures of the Wilderness family".	Packin' It In
Okay, I have this movie stuck in my head from my childhood (late 90’s early 2000’s) about a child abductor that gives his victims these small chocolate spiders. But the scene I’m remembering is a different man (not the abductor) sitting at a picnic table, I believe outside of like a gas station maybe?, and he’s given the chocolate spiders from someone.    Am I making this movie up?! Please tell me it’s real! 😂	The Pledge
I fell asleep watching a movie on Tubi And Tubi just plays random movies when they are finished. I woke up to a movie that I actually want to watch. I saw a scene and I fell back asleep. I wasn't logged in so I can't check the history. The scene was a man and a woman laying in bed. Then they found a bug in the bed with them. The man kept saying it was an aphid. Then he said I was a plant lice. They were having a discussion about the bugs.. Then he made her get out of bed so they can check for more bugs. They got into an argument and he left... She ran into the bathroom crying. I don't know anymore than that.	Bug

I don't remember a lot but as far as I remember, there were small black things like nanochips or small robots. And also an invention competition. And a school got burned in the past. Maybe a high school.	Big hero 6
ok guys I actually cant remember a lot about this movie. I just remember that a child found a kind of green hexagon artifact on the beach and It was kinda alien like. It was a strange and weird movie as I was a kid.    For Brazilian fellas It used to show often on SBT.	The Last Mimzy
It got up to the point that he grew up to be a rich successful man and challenged that same teacher that he can answer a lot of questions now. He got quizzed again but this time he's cheating via an earpiece where he got an assistant to look over every resource to feed him answers, but there's one answer he could not find as the answer is not in any book and ended up losing the challenge again.    Anyone know the title of the movie? Even forgot who the actors were. Thanks!	The Emperors Club
ok so i only saw a little bit of the end but the old coach antagonizes the boxer and to prove a point they cut the boxers gloves off and the two bore knuckle fight , the old coach is better and ends up hurting the boxers fist by dipping his head to take a punch to the hardest spot on the head. and ends when the boxer copy's the moves and shows he is in fact better. but i don't know the year (has to be after 2000 I'm sure ) and i don't know the name, does this ring ANY bells with anyone?

Hi    I am looking for a movie where a woman goes to someone (a producer I think?) and have her music recorded. Then suddenly, without her knowledge or accept, the music is released, but with another younger and sexier woman being the face of it. She then tries to get her credit for it.    I saw it on TV once, but fell asleep and cannot find it again.    Any idea what movie it could be?	Out of Sync (aka Lip Service)
Not sure if I dreamt this (pretty sure I didn't) but I remember hearing about a movie where a paricipant in a reality tv show where they have to stay alive in the wilderness alone with just a camera for longer than other contestants (like the tv show 'Alone') but it turns out while he was participating in the show, the world is invaded by aliens (or some other apocalyptic event happens) and he/she has no idea.    I think it might be a horror? Tried googling all the keywords but can't seem to find it.	Man Vs
Its a clip of I think either a teacher/sensei or a father figure scolding a younger person.

Help me find this psycho movie!!!  It's been such a long time that l've trying to find a thriller/horror psycho movie that I once watched in a movie theater. It was years ago but I still remember vividly the unsettling feeling it left me. I have no clue regarding the name but it was about a girl that was in a house in the forest and someone was trying to kill her (there were two or more people that got killed), we didn't really see the killer's face, who was a fat old man, but we could see very detailed shots of his hands, his shoes, his mouth... giving very graphic disgusting images. At the end of the movie we realize that actually this man didn't exist, that actually the killer was this girl all along, she was hallucinating this man existed kind of like an alter ego. Please let me know if you know which film l'm talking about!!!	High tension
What movie is this? Teen joins a cult...  Its probably from 2003-2008ish but I could be wrong. I think it starts with O or L? I feel like the name is something like Oxytocin but it's not that    Its about a teen rebel that joins some weird cult where these people either believe they're immortal or something like that? I think she goes in a truck to this house to where this guy who looks sort of goth-like is and then the end of the film I think her mom comes to rescue her and burns down a garage while he's in or on top of a car?    Its American or Canadian but I feel like its likely American and probably in L.A but I can't be sure    Driving me crazy trying to remember it. Thanks	Octane
Scary movie.  I'm searching for a horror film I can vaguely remember. The most vivid scene I can think of is a mother is driving her daughter in the car and she's asking for ice cream. When the mother looks in the rearview she sees a very demonic version of this child and decided to roll the car in a lake. When she gets home the girl is then sitting at the kitchen table dripping wet and still asking for ice cream.    I also know that a few kids are kidnapped and replaced with these false children with demonic reflections and I can't remember for the life of me. Any help is much appreciated ☺️	Supernatural

A western movie about an american indian and man  My 13yo son is describing a movie he watched a few years back. He really wants to watch it again, but I can't figure it out. He says it starts with a white horse stuck in a tree. The man trades peanuts with the american indian to help get the horse out. He also details a train wreck where they are outside the train and its crashing toward them on the track. Also, he said something about being in a museum. A chance the american indian was was a manequin. So I thought Night at the Museum, Neverending Story and even the Ridiculous 6. None of those are it. Wonder if he may be combining details from multiple movies. Forgive formatting on mobile.	The Lone Ranger
Desert psychological thriller  I thought this was a Patrick Swayze film but nothing in his filmography fits. Came out in the late 90's perhaps. As I recall, a couple are driving through the desert and they breakdown or stop in a small town for some reason. But when the male lead wakes up the townsfolk and everyone gaslight him pretending they don't know who he is or that he even had a girlfriend/partner. That's pretty much all I can remember. Any help?

An Asian horror film with a title like "night session"  The main character is a young guy whose little sister was kidnapped. Some scenes take place in the cinema hall In the end, when he finds her, he sees that his sister's eyes have been gouged out. The kidnapper is like the ghost of a female actress who was mutilated and killed out of envy (but this is not accurate). The appearance of the characters was similar to Thai. Maybe someone knows this movie?	Coming Soon
Name of the movie where a guy wife accidentally died and all his friends were happy  Yeah yeah I know that title is kinda vague. But essentially it’s a movie starring a black actor whose wife died during some kinda get together they were hosting. She slipped and fell on the kitchen floor I think. I also remember a scene where they had put her in a garbage bag and place the bag inside of the boot of a car then the neighbor who’s a cop came and was talking to the husband. I might be wrong but I think the name was something another wife must die or something with wife dead etc, I watched it years ago.	Let's Kill Ward's Wife
Movie about an armed (military?) unit moves through some wall that separates a "safe" side and a side filled with different groups. They enter within some sort of armoured vehicle and ofc something goes wrong and they get chased and some (if not all) get captured by some savages/anarchists that iirc used motor bikes quite alot. They got kind of an mad max-y vibe to them and they kill/torture some of the people and eat them (i think).    Dont really remember much after that point, and this might just be incomprehensible rambling. But i believe the movie was released somewhere around/inbetween 2000-2010	Doomsday
A movie about a father and his son, and music  Son and dad don't get along. Dad likes old 30s/40s music, while son likes 60s/70s music (I may have the decades wrong). They're both music lovers but dad is disappointed in the music his son listens to and the modern lifestyle he has picked up (going to concerts, maybe drugs, etc.).    This prompts the son to leave home for years. Dad gets a call one day to let him know that son is ill. He returns home on a wheelchair, all limp, with no memories of who he or anyone is, and unable to speak.    Dad one day finds out the son's music kind of wakes him. His son would start talking about his music and festival experience with so much life in his eyes. Essentially, the son starts remembering things and being himself again, but it all stops as soon as the music ends.    Dad ends up taking his son to these concerts to bring his son back.    I won't ruin the ending, but if you know the name of the film, it's greatly appreciated. It was truly such an inspiring, heartwarming story.	The Music Never Stopped
From what I remember, the movie is about a young girl who is placed in a home after being with an abusive father.

There is this movie trailer that was supposed to come out in like 2014 or something, and in the trailer it shows a guy seemingly like, on the run and he get to a bathroom and it reveals that he is a robot. Then I think there is shooting happening after. The main guy(robot protagonist) kinda looks like this helldivers helmet    someone please help me out lol    I thought the title of the movie was a similar title to a game which is how I believe I initially found it. Thought it was Prey or Predator but can’t find it.	The Prototype
So I've had this movie stuck in my head for days and I can't figure out what the hell it is and can only remember one scene lmao so basically what I remember is that a guy goes to see his gf at her like office or corporate job or something and he's going to see her for like their anniversary or something, and they're supposed to be going out to dinner together but she says she can't go because something came up with work so her bf and her dorky male assistant end up sitting in her office together eating the chocolate and stuff he got for her lmao please help me. It's definitely a comedy too!	New Girl
Ok so a friend of mine has been wondering about a movie that she saw when she was around 10/11 (2016), but the movie was probably older.    She says that in the movie a young boy moved to a building where a girl had died after falling from the top of the stairs in the building. He decided to investigate her death and found out that what really happened was that she had jumped from the top so that her mother/nanny could catch her, but missed and she died. My friend also adds that the boy moved to the building to be with his uncle, who had a room full of taxidermy animals and the boy could not come inside. The animal's eyes were really diamonds, and those where important in the plot for solving some mystery or something.    I can't remember if she mentioned anything else, but these were the main points. She is not sure if the movie is Spanish (we are from Spain) or not, so maybe it was not really popular in other countries.    Maybe this description is not of one movie but two or more! She wouldn't be surprised if that was the case, as this is the only things she remembers.    Thanks in advance!!!	Victor and the Secret of Crocodile Mansion
kids film 80's-00's  I don't have much to go on but i have been searching for this film since i remembered it about 3 years ago and i absolutely could not find it no matter how hard i looked.    At the beginning there were these two sisters who went out for ice cream and then a little bit later, they were left alone by their mother who specifically told them not to go into the attic but they did anyway and they found something (I'm pretty sure it was a glove) and they ended up in a different reality and other than that I can't really remember much. There was an evil queen who kinda looked like the evil queen from snow white and there was a boy i think. we had it on vhs tape and it for some reason reminds me of the vhs snow queen that came out in 1995 if any of you guys know abt that.    Any help would be appreciated.	The Princess Castle
Youtube Animation about time travel?  this girl is living in a futuristic world, where she meets a future version of herself. She has been cloned and has lived multiple lives. Her future clone comes back and talks to her about what life has in store over the next couple centuries    Its very colorful, and the characters are mainly stick figures. there's a boy in a tube who is a living human without consciousness, and the girl is able to relate to him.    I know this is really unhelpful, but I stg this thing must've been taken down.	World of Tomorrow
Hi, so for the life of me I cant remember this film but I remember it so vividly.    It starts with like these little animated people racing and then like the princess of the world is one of the racers and her dad like gets mad. Then they somehow travel to the real world and she falls in love with one of the bad guys.    There's also this scene where they go through a TV shop and look at themselves on the tv's.

I remember watching this movie long ago. It was live action and featured a guy with some kind if living tongue that, at the end if the movie, is used as a kind of whip to fight off alien spaceships (I think the spaceships were in the shape of pyramids?).    I remember there being a scene in there where the protagonist had his arm wounded, and ask a girl (I don't remember who) to disinfect it, so the girl applies substances like salt and alcohol in increasing orders of severity, but the guy keeps saying that it doesn't burn enough, so the girl then sets his arm on fire.    I'm not sure, but I think it's also about martial arts? But again, I'm nit sure about that one.    Also, yes, as stupid and weird as this may seem, I'm being 100% serious	Kung pow enter the fist

It’s a movie about this Asian guy who is being hunted down his other universe self who is killing all of the other Him from across other dimensions and at the end he kills his doppelgänger and gets sent to a dimension where he meets women as his reward who I can only assume is his love in a veterinary hospital	The One with a jet Li
Horror movie revolving around the end of the world  This movie is completely seen through a handheld camera, where one character is always filming. I think it's about a group of tourists or reporters who are vacationing (In the Vatican City?) and suddenly the whole city is attacked by these things from the sky who look like angels. It's the end of the world, and these people keep running around to save themselves. In the end, only one person is left as she watches the angel grab the last guy, and the camera falls to the ground implying she was taken too.    I do remember that it wasn't a great movie, and looked like a documentary. It ran around 90-100 mins, not very much.    Please help me out!!	JeruZalem

Horror movie???  between 10-8 years ago i’m going to say, i saw a part of what i’m thinking a horror movie.. my sister was watching Orphan(a horror movie) and i was walking in and out of the room. there was a scene where i think a mother had her daughter in a car and the daughter in the backseat said something about ice cream maybe and the mother drives off a free way into a ocean/river/water. the daughter reminds me of the daughter in Orphan and tried to fight the mom like in the pond scene. the mom gets out of the car in the water and it sinks with the girl in it i believe.. i always assumed it was apart of Orphan but years later I discovered it was not and have spend hours of my life searching for the movie scene i remember in my mind from when i was a kid. anybody possibly know what this movie may be?

Thriller movie ? Mystery movie ?  I watched a movie back in 2019 on netflix, cannot for the life of me remember the name or who was even in it. I thought Daniel Kaluuya was in it but I checked all his movies and none of them match.    Anyways, I'm a bit foggy on the details but basically the movie was about this guy that came back from the military, had some ptsd, and stayed with his wife, and his kid. He lost his brother in the military. He was doing drugs, was an addict, and would crazy hallucinate every time. I can't remember much but the ending so I guess I'll spoil it. Lol. It turns out he never lost his brother, he was hallucinating the whole time and his "wife" was his brother's wife. He just imagined the whole life he was living and it was actually his brother's. He was the drug addict. Also the drug he was doing was actually like. Killing people and making them hallucinate like that. It was wild. Idk. Im not even sure this will help.    Thanks if you read all of this!	Jacobs Ladder
Dystopian movie involving a small village segregated from the rest of the world.  I saw this movie many years ago but can't recall the name. It features a small village in which the people are kept in line and kept from wandering outside of the village by fear of a (spoiler alert) fake creature they call "ManBearPig" or "ManBearWolf", something like that, which comes around every time someone does something not permited. Eventually a young woman in the village stumbles upon a shack where she sees the ManBearPig costume and realizes she's been lied to all her life and attempts her escape. I thought this should be easy to Google but ManBearPig only brings up the South Park stuff, so I might be slightly off with the name of the creature.    Anyway, thanks for everyone's help!	The Village
This movie I want to say came out within the last 20 years. What I remember from it is that the final scene is this woman (maybe possessed or something) chasing a man and woman in an abandoned building. Maybe an abandoned pool? Everyone is around high school age and I want to say this might've been happening during their prom. My memory is very fuzzy of it so none of these descriptions are concrete.	Jennifer's Body
Basically it was about a very religious family living in the middle of nowhere, it was a father, mother, and two daughters. They would set up traps to pop travelers tires and keep them hostage in their house. First it would seem like the family would help the travelers and then the father would try to kill them. A few college guys end up being victim and one of the guys falls in love w a daughter. The father was often abusive to the daughters, and the plot twist was that the daughters didn’t actually belong to their supposed parents, they were both stolen from previous travelers and never told their original parents were killed.	We Are What We Are
I’m at my absolute wits end because I can’t think of what this movie is. I believe it was similar to “it follows” (but not the same), in that people are compelled to kill others by this supernatural-ish force.    One of the scenes in the movie (maybe the beginning?) starts with a man taking a gun and shooting two of his neighbours - the man out in the street I believe and then he shoots the woman through the front door of a house. I believe the movie was relatively new (200s onwards?) but this scene in particular was set somewhere in the 60s or 70s. It was jarring because it seemed like a lovely suburb, and then the man shot them in broad daylight.    If anyone has any idea that would be wonderful:) thank you!	The Bye Bye Man
What's that horror movie that's based in the present day about a demonic entity resulting from a dark past involving a witch exorcising spirits and storing them in her daughter. The flashbacks of the past events take place in early Louisiana or nearby area of the United States.	The Skeleton Key
Name that movie where the woman marries a man suspected of killing his wife  She starts off as a female companion for this rich elderly woman where she meets this man at the establishment they were staying at and they immediately fall in love. The old lady sort of gaslights the woman by saying things like she's poor and he would never find you interesting because he's rich blahblah and then the two protagonists end up marrying and living together on the man's estate where things start to unravel. The female protagonist thinks that the man still isn't over his dead wife but it turns out that the previous marriage was all arranged and they never really liked each other so they go on for years living together in this toxic marriage and so the ex-wife gets onto a boat and dies and everyone thinks that the husband did it somehow and fast forward to present day they suddenly find the boat of the dead wife and the body of the dead wife and they proceed with a trial where the husband is placed into custody and so the female protagonist has to investigate the case on her own and it turns out that the ex-wife was dying with some illness and that's why she was that way and that's why she staged her own death in a way that they would blame the husband but then a new twist occurs where the ex-wife's hand-maid or something like that has some sort of twisted crush/adoration for the ex-wife and tries to prevent the truth from coming out. In the end the male and female protagonist live happily ever after but in another country.	Rebecca
Name of movie where guy shoots three kids at dinner table, then father.  Ok, so, I saw a scene from a movie that I want to know the name of. It's a guy and his three sons sitting down at the dinner table, then a guy comes in with a gun, talks to the father, then after some talking (the gunman asks the father if the kids know english, then the conversation turns from subtitled Spanish to English), he shoots the three kids, then the father.

B rated Zombie movie  Ok I watched the weirdest zombie movie a couple years ago and I need to find it again. It's about a group of police officers who have to transport a violent serial killer (who grew up in a circus murder cult) to prison. Unfortunately the transport goes through the hometown of one of the officers, who conveniently forgets that once a year a witch curses the town to have all their dead come to life, and that day is the one the transport is scheduled to drive through. So obviously they get stuck in the town, the killer escapes & now the cops have to find the serial killer & stop the evil witch from destroying the town all while dealing with the zombies. Its honestly one of the wildest and most terrible movies I've ever seen & I'm dying to watch it again. Any help is greatly appreciated.	bonejangles
Movie about kid with disability  Made a post earlier and then it reminded me of another movie I could never find the name of. It was about this kid who had a disability I think he had like an enlarged chest or something. He was blonde and had glasses, this was like an 80s or 90s movie. I remember like 2 scenes, one where a baseball ends up hitting and killing a random lady or his mom straight in the head (or she survives but again cant remember). And then also a school bus with him in it falls off a cliff or something and ends up in water and I feeeeeel like he died by drowning, I remember this movie making me cry. I watched it when I was in elementary school but it always stuck with me.	Simon Birch
This movie is a British film that came out probably somewhere in the 50’s, I think. It’s a movie about a man who films himself murdering women and he wants to create a documentary about it so the “world can see his masterpiece” or whatever. I do remember a particular scene where he hides a small camera in his jacket and he approaches a prostitute, goes to a room, and proceeds to murder her (off camera). Any suggestions would help!	Peeping Tom
Netflix in the days of old used to have a much higher assortment of foreign films, indie films and so on. Well, in 2011, I saw a movie that depicted a Rorschach Watchmen esque man sitting atop a city. Thought what the hell, let’s give it a go. I liked the movie enough to want to remember it and wrote it down, sadly that paper was lost years ago.    Anyways, I believe it to be British made film in where a man dealing with trauma has created inside himself the idea and narrative he is a superhero (who is actually currently in cell block CTscan if ya catch my drift), with this belief we see the man overlay his idea of how just he is being in his actions by being given the vivid imagery of a dystopian cityscape and him believing to be the antihero everyone is beckoning for. Multiple scenes of what seem a muted color and cool action stealth transpire. He has a nemesis throughout these “visions” however it is not immediately anthropomorphized in the storyline or plot. Alongside this bag of marbles doing his thing, people are living separately from his plot line, however, showing their struggles and problems. (More) normal people continue to thread together until the ending, where the escapee (superhero) tries to kill his father (nemesis) from a rooftop overlooking a restaurant where his father and said normies are dining. The whole thing is basically is an outcry to the simplest and farthest reaches of issues when it comes to mental health and their resolution.    I don’t know it’s name. As the famous Princess Leia said.    “Help me [Reddit], you’re my only hope.”	Franklyn
obscure kids movie??  first time posting on reddit, sorry for any errors. i swear i watched this animated movie about forest animals, but i CANNOT find the name of it. there were definitely bunnies and there was a human also, and i'm pretty sure the bad guys were trying to poach the animals. the bad guys lived in a castle and they had crows (or some black bird) as pets, and the scene that i remember most vividly is the little kid and animals sneaking into the castle and distracting the crows by feeding them meat that looked like raspberries. the movie definitely isn't the rescuers down under, it's not fern gully or once upon a forest. please help.

Old spooky movie about twin boys, one keeps doing evil things like putting a pitchfork in a hayloft where his cousin would fall on it and be injured/killed. The nurse/caretaker was teaching him to go out of his body into a crow.  I came across this movie more than once on TV decades ago, but each time I missed the beginning so I don't know the name. Things I remember: the one boy scared a woman with a mouse, planted a pitchfork so his cousin fell on it jumping out of the hayloft, drowned a baby in a vat of liquor in imitation of a preserved hydrocephalic baby he saw in a circus. There is a subplot about a ring of his father's. Near the end you find that one of the twins has been dead the whole time.	The Other
Movie about a fat family in a town full of skinny people?  I remember there being this 3 membered fat family and they think it's awesome then they move somewhere else and everyone is skinny there. There's a girl whose mother is obsessed about making her the skinniest girl in town and the girl steals the fat boys lunch or something. I remember it being foreign but no idea which country.

the movie with the shape shifting ailen  I remember this one movie about these researchers finding something in ice and bringing it into their facility. Then they figure out it can shapeshift and take the form of one of them. I remember there was something about dogs and a helicopter. I think it was an old movie because the monster was not CGI and you could see the strings that were used to move it but it was seriously disgusting.	The Thing
all i remember is there is like a demon possessed girl on a bed and there’s a mirror and the mirror falls out of the mirror onto a car. it’s a horror movie.	Constantine
Asian fantasy film about frozen warriors waking up in modern day?  Can’t remember the name of this one, only that it came out in the last few years.

So i remember that there's a couple guys in a bed room and they think they're in the hot chick's room. They find a vibtator and one of them starts smelling the panties and one is licking the vibrator. Then the hot girl walks in and says "WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY MOM'S ROOM!??!?"

"I had a man around. He used to wake me up every morning by flicking lit cigarettes at my head. He'd say, "Hey, asshole, get up and make me breakfast".

People are stuck in an airport and a killer likes to rip paper.  I think the movie came out of the 80s or 90s. I remember there being a bunch of people stuck in an airport that no one could get out of. Definitely a physiological thriller movie.    The bad guy was a person who loved the sound of tearing paper. I think there was a blind child character too.    At the end of the movie, the airport begins to fall into the ground or disappear as they are finally flying away from being stuck in a weird airport.    Does this ring a bell to anyone out there?

Matt Damon Lucky Phone Movie  There is a film where potentially Matt Damon gets these random texts from an unknown number about the future and he uses it to get lucky in a casino at one point. I know it came out around the 2010s and the phone he was receiving texts on was an old brick phone and it was an action film.	Echelon Conspiracy
A group of friends walk pretty far through the woods to go camping, and when they get there, a friend that no body likes was invited and I think brought a bunch of drugs. Anyways, everyone is drinking and getting messed up, having a good time. The next morning, one wakes up to go pee or something and finds one of their friends dead. They all start suspecting each other of killing him, and start killing each other in order to survive the killer. In the end, turns out their friend was never actually dead, just fell down the hill, and hit his head really hard and appeared dead....So basically everyone killed each other for no reason....Pleassssseeeee tell me SOMEONE knows this movie, or can take anything sensible from what I just tried to explain...lol!!

Deaf Kid With a Pet Crab  Someone please help me. I remember sometime in the 90's watching this movie (tv movie?) on PBS (maybe it was one of those BBC things they showed on PBS). What I can remember is that it was probably a period drama that took place in the 1960's or 1970's and there was this boy with brown hair (maybe glasses) - maybe 11 or 12 who was deaf. He spoke with impaired speech and had some kind of old hearing aid where the receiver was like a Walkman or something with a wire earphone. The kid lives by the water and gets this crab (maybe a blue crab) that he calls Captain Claw and takes home in his lunchbox or something as a pet. The kid doesn't fit in socially and some other mean kids smash Captain Claw to death and the deaf kid has an emotional breakdown. I think I stopped watching at that point because it was the most depressing thing I'd ever seen.    So anyway, I'm from Maryland and yesterday I had a bunch of people over for a crab feast and it was delicious and amazing, but it suddenly reminded me of Captain Claw and now I have to find out what happened to this poor deaf kid. Google isn't giving me any answers. Please help!	Captain Johnno
Movie with desert scene and ship shows up?  I remember a movie with a scene where it's like in the desert and I feel like there's a pyramid or some kind of structure with this old guy and a few other people and this ship approaches and these like robotic aliens with sort of fat bodies come out to retrieve something from inside the pyramid/structure. Later on in the scene I remember one of the guys shoots one of them and the older guy is going no no and a stone door shuts as the robotic alien is saying something to the old guy about protecting something until they return again. It's really bothering me because I remember it so clearly.	Fifth Element
child psychologist?  i have no idea if it was a movie or tv show, a child psychologist or counsellor talks to this kid who’s seeing monsters or something, the psychologist goes to the kid’s house (which she isn’t allowed to do) and finds out the kid sleeps on a sofa in the basement, and then figured out the foster dad was abusing the kid	Haunting at Hill House
It was about a girl that was a wanna be journalist or something similar. There was some murders going on. She teams up with a cop and falls for him. Eventually she realizes that report has to be wrong because the one handed man couldn't tie a noose the way it was. The couple ended up having sex in a car (maybe his cruiser) and she ends up discovering her crush is the killer. She ends up pregnant in the end. I was really young and i remember vividly but don't remember the name.	True Crime
I can't, for the life of me, remember what the name of the film was, or if it was from an anthology movie. In it, a guy is hired to locate a cursed film that was a snuff film with a live angel. At the end, the guy watches the movie with the guy who paid him to find it, and it kills them like they expected. The angel is bound in chains in the guy's basement where he tore his wings off and gets free, taking the film with it.    It was a weird movie, but i remember it so well except for the name.

From what I remember it’s about a boy who is caught in a storm and rescued by nuns. He recovers but loses his sight. Throughout the movie he learns to sing with the help of the nuns and a choir. At the end of the movie at some kind of Christmas recital he regains his sight and everyone is happy. If I remember right it was a stop motion movie, but the kind of stop motion like in Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer. That’s all I can remember.	The First Christmas: The Story of the First Christmas Snow
