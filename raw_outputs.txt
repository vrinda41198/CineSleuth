I remember this 90's low budget R movie, I think the main character falls for his (very blond) co star in the crime reenactments that are made for TV. I think at the end she sets him up to be the actual criminal who is known to break into women house's and hides in the closet waiting to attacks them. It was a late night movie on HBO (or maybe Showtime/Cinemax) so it had Nudity but not excessive, so its most likely an erotic thriller and I do remember it having a sex scene in a (blue?) public bathroom stall at some point. Feel like it might have been a rip off of basic instinct, would have been early 90's though, maybe like 93ish (but maybe earlier too). Description of the main actors (to the best of my memory).

The king freaks out and chases the boy throughout the castle, but he didn’t see the boy’s face so he doesn’t know exactly who it is. He chases him back to the servant quarters which are like, a bunch of cots in a row with a ton of other servants sleeping in them. The servant boy lays down in his cot and pretends to be asleep, and the king comes down and starts to lean down and listen to all the servant’s hearts while they’re sleeping to see who’s heart is beating the fastest from running to find out which boy was kissing his daughter.

To be frank, it had a made-for-tv feel, almost like a Lifetime movie. Feels fairly recent nonetheless (at least, released after 2010-ish). Also the setting was possibly British (or northeastern US?) and the vibe was peculiarly conservative in its portrayal of dating and marriage.

The only part I saw of this movie was that there were two little boys and a woman. I think the boys were brothers and one was a few years older than the other. The younger one was probably 4 or 5 maybe. The boys tied up the woman to a chair. I don't believe this woman was their mom, but maybe it could be a gf of their dad or maybe their stepmom? That detail I'm not sure about, but the way they were treating her made it seem that way. The older boy was being mean to the woman but the younger boy was trying to get the woman a glass of water or something. On the way over to the woman, the youngest boy falls down and lands on the drinking glass, breaking it into pieces. The pieces of glass go into the boys chest or abdomen. The woman then starts begging the older boy to let her go so that she could take his brother to the hospital.

I don't remember much, here's everything I remember: There's a woman who claims she's receiving harassing phone calls from an anonymous man. She and her husband contact the police, who tries to trace them. At one point, when the woman says the man is on the phone, the husband tells her to keep him on the line so he can talk to him, I think so the police can trace it. But by the time he gets there, she hangs up, she says she was too scared to keep talking to him. The police officer investigating it talks to the husband, and implies that he suspects the woman is faking it. The husband is talking to a friend about it, and says he didn't like the police officer's implication, but then says he supposes it's his job to look at it from all angles. Later, the woman says the man is calling her, and everyone including the husband thinks she's hallucinating it, I think it's because the phone was disconnected or something like that, and she's sent to a psychiatric hospital. Then it turns out the husband was somehow behind it all, and he was planning to kill her, but I don't remember any other details. I think there's also a subplot, but I don't remember it.

But the son became paralytic and the parents were forced to look after him. Throughout the movie they all struggle to the new lifestyle of the boy. I think the movie was shot in the 70\'s, because the parents wear formal clothes in public places. I only remember two scenes. Just after the parents received the bad news, they walked outside the doctor\'s office through a hallway. They were walking slowly towards the camera, and the camera was walking backwards. The wife was holding his husband\'s arm tightly, as if she was feeling that she was gonna faint. Again, formal clothes. I guess this is towards the end of the film. The mom decided to read a book for his son while he was paralytic in bed, not being able to move any single muscle. She started reading and reading but he remained motionless. But then, I don\'t remember if he blinked or moved his chin, the point is that the kid responded to his mom reading the book. That gave her hope that his son is still aware, so she continued to read.

Another was where a guy thought he was being seduced by a woman, but turned out to be a zombie of some sort.

She says that in the movie a young boy moved to a building where a girl had died after falling from the top of the stairs in the building. He decided to investigate her death and found out that what really happened was that she had jumped from the top so that her mother/nanny could catch her, but missed and she died. My friend also adds that the boy moved to the building to be with his uncle, who had a room full of taxidermy animals and the boy could not come inside. The animal\'s eyes were really diamonds, and those where important in the plot for solving some mystery or something.    I can\'t remember if she mentioned anything else, but these were the main points. She is not sure if the movie is Spanish (we are from Spain) or not, so maybe it was not really popular in other countries.    Maybe this description is not of one movie but two or more!

I think it's about a group of tourists or reporters who are vacationing (In the Vatican City?) and suddenly the whole city is attacked by these things from the sky who look like angels. It's the end of the world, and these people keep running around to save themselves.

I liked the movie enough to want to remember it and wrote it down, sadly that paper was lost years ago.    Anyways, I believe it to be British made film in where a man dealing with trauma has created inside himself the idea and narrative he is a superhero (who is actually currently in cell block CTscan if ya catch my drift), with this belief we see the man overlay his idea of how just he is being in his actions by being given the vivid imagery of a dystopian cityscape and him believing to be the antihero everyone is beckoning for. Multiple scenes of what seem a muted color and cool action stealth transpire. He has a nemesis throughout these “visions” however it is not immediately anthropomorphized in the storyline or plot. Alongside this bag of marbles doing his thing, people are living separately from his plot line, however, showing their struggles and problems. (More) normal people continue to thread together until the ending, where the escapee (superhero) tries to kill his father (nemesis) from a rooftop overlooking a restaurant where his father and said normies are dining.
